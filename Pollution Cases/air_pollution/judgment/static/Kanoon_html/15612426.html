                hazardous.            Therefore, prior environmental clearance of the Central

                Government was mandatory. On 16.01.1995, the Ministry of Environment,

                Forest and Climate Change (MoEF &amp; CC) granted environmental clearances

                for the project.        Thereafter, the Government of Tamil Nadu, the Department

                of Forest granted environmental clearance on 17.05.1995. In terms of the

                provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_40">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_41">Water Act</a>, the petitioner was required to obtain

                consent to establish the plant. This was granted by the TNPCB on 22.05.1995,

                to manufacture 234 tonnes of blister copper per day and 638 tonnes of

                sulphuric acid per day. The order of consent contained various conditions. By

                during November 1996, essentially challenging the grant of environmental

                clearance and other related matters. On 01.01.1997, the petitioner commenced

                production. During April 1997, W.P.No.5769 of 1997, was filed challenging

                the grant of environmental clearance, dated 06.01.1995 and the clearance

                granted by the State Government, dated 17.05.1995. Within about seven

                months, after commencement of production, the petitioner was visited with an

                order of closure dated 06.07.1997, on account of an incident regarding gas

                leakage. The State Government, presumably taking note of the concern

                expressed by the local public, constituted a Committee to investigate into the

                incident. It is the petitioner's case that upon reports being submitted by the

                Expert Committee, the TNPCB by order dated 13.08.1997, ordered reopening

                of the plant and permitted the petitioner to commence and continue

                production. Subsequently, during June 1998, the State Government appointed

                another team of experts to examine the working of the petitioner's unit.

                from 26.12.1998 to 28.02.1999.      On 09.02.1999, NEERI opined that the

                such report, permitted the petitioner to operate the plant, by order dated

                23.02.1999. Presumably during the period when the plant was to operate on

                experimental basis, the full production capacity could not have been achieved

                Roughly about the said time, the petitioner made an application for expansion

                of its production capacity from 391 tonnes of copper per day to 900 tonnes per

                the application filed by the petitioner for renewal of consent to operate. On

                07.03.2016, the CPCB issued notification regarding harmonisation of

                classification of industries under 'red', 'orange' etc., categories. It is only on

                13.04.2016, the TNPCB renewed the consent to operate till 31.03.2017.

                mean time appears to have sought for police protection and also addressed the

                TNPCB on 26.03.2018, stating that the plant has been shutdown for repairs

                and maintenance. The petitioner moved the Madurai Bench of this Court in

                W.P.(MD)No.7313 of 2018, requesting for grant of police protection, which

                Writ Petition was disposed of by order dated 04.04.2018, by directing the

                filed before the Appellate Authority was heard, TNPCB had filed their

                response and the matter was adjourned from time to time. The petitioner

                moved the Madurai Bench of this Court in W.P.(MD).No.11190 of 2018, to

                petitioner prefaced his submission by contending that the first ground raised

                by the petitioner challenging the impugned orders is on the ground of violation

                of principles of natural justice, as no notice was issued to the petitioner

                alleging pollution, no explanation was called for, but series of orders were

                passed including cancellation of various licenses granted to the petitioner.

                Though such a ground has been canvassed, the petitioner requested the Court

                to hear the case on merits, since if the petitioner succeeds in establishing that

                there has been serious violation of principles of natural justice, the

                none of them have been issued such authorisation, but no action has been

                taken to close down any such industry. It is further submitted that the state of

                unsustainable especially when, there has been no complaint of pollution from

                2013 till 2016 and in April 2016, environmental clearance was granted for

                Copper Plant-II and earlier expansion of Phase-I was permitted and increase in

                production capacity by the process of de-bottlenecking was also permitted.

                that along with the inspection report, there is a scrutiny report, which has

                recommended renewal of consent for five years, which has not been produced

                by the respondents. For the first time in April 2018, there is an allegation of

                groundwater pollution, when the fact remains that the ground water analysis

                report, dated 30.04.2018, shows it is within the permissible parameters.

                Further, the allegation of groundwater pollution was not one of the grounds for

                passing the impugned order dated 09.04.2018 and for the first time in the

                pleadings filed before the NGT, TNPCB raised such a ground.

                situation, where emergent action is required in the matter, when act of

                pollution is continuous and when following normal course of action will delay

                the matters and to ensure prompt action considering the emergent situation.

                Thus, only under such circumstances, the Chairman of TNPCB can invoke

                such a power and not otherwise. It is submitted that the above mentioned

                factors warranting exercise of power are absent in the instant case and such

                power could not have been exercised by the Chairman, TNPCB. Further, it is

                submitted that the order of refusal to renew the consent is not final, as on

                compliance of the conditions, consent can be granted. Further, the learned

                18.05.2018 and 19.05.2018 and disputed the taxi receipts produced by the

                TNPCB, as proof of officials having travelled for conducting inspection.

                should go. Further, commenting upon the impugned Government Order, it is

                submitted that the Government wanted to prove a political point and what

                motivated the Government to pass the order, is not to safeguard against

                pollution, but for extraneous consideration and the order is a colourable

                exercise of power. It is submitted that the main allegation that one of the

                reasons for closure as stated in the order dated 09.04.2018, is that the copper

                slag has not been removed. Even as per the stand taken by the MoEF and

                TNPCB, copper slag is non-hazardous and the designated use of copper slag as

                land fill has been authorised by the CPCB, sale of copper slag to private party

                has been permitted by the TNPCB and the petitioner has entered into

                agreements with private parties for sale of slag and the TNPCB is aware of the

                same. The copper slag, which has been stored in the patta land, belongs to a

                private party, who had purchased the slag and the TNPCB instead of initiating

                action against the land owner, cannot proceed against the petitioner. It is

                submitted that though the petitioner is not the owner of the said land, on their

                not the cause. Further, it is reiterated that non-removal of slag by a private

                party cannot be a reason for closure. Furthermore, when consent was renewed

                on 07.09.2017, two conditions were imposed which are new conditions and

                therefore, these cannot be a reason to order closure. Further, it is submitted

                that the authorities were aware of the fact that the slag was stored by the patta

                landowner and not by the petitioner and that is why no notice was issued to the

                petitioner. Further, for the first time in the pleadings, it is stated that copper

                slag is a pollutant and there was no such allegation in any of the orders passed

                TNPCB had taken a clear stand that the slag is non-hazardous and it is non-

                leachable and would not affect groundwater and this was based upon the stand

                taken by the CPCB. Further, by referring to various test reports of TNPCB, it

                is submitted that the parameters have been found to be within permissible

                limits.       Further, it is submitted that the application for hazardous waste

                management authorisation was pending and there are several such industries in

                the State, whose applications are pending and the petitioner had been

                continuously submitting representations for renewal of the authorisation.

                Further, in terms of Rule 6(1)(a)(b) of the HWM Rules, authorisation under

                the Rules is not a pre-condition for obtaining consent to establish or to operate.

                It is submitted that when the impugned order dated 09.04.2018, was passed,

                the application for renewal of authorisation was pending. Therefore, the same

                could not have been a reason for rejection of the renewal of consent to operate.

                It is submitted that the TNPCB had recommended for renewal of HW

                authorisation with 16 conditions, therefore, the reason stated in paragraph 3 of

                the impugned order dated 09.04.2018, is wrong. Further, it is submitted that

                while granting renewal of consent dated 07.09.2017, there was no specific

                condition that the test will be conducted in the Board's laboratory, as in the

                past i.e., from 2002, the test reports were submitted by the petitioner as

                conducted by M/s.Vimta Labs and if the petitioner had been informed that test

                has to be conducted through a particular laboratory, they were willing to do so.

                Further, even assuming that the test had to be conducted in the Board's

                laboratory or an accredited laboratory, it is only a remediable breach and

                cannot be a reason for closure.

                however the same cannot be done in five weeks, as its a 40 acre pond.

                Furthermore, even as per the guidelines issued in October 2014, the petitioner

                had time to comply till September 2019 and the same cannot be a ground for

                closure. Furthermore, at no earlier point of time, there was any allegation

                about gypsum except in the year 2003, when it was pointed out that there is

                excess stock which was later promptly disposed of by the petitioner.

                monthly reports, which were filed and submitted that the approach of the

                TNPCB should be fair and unbiased and their decision is open to judicial

                show that the copper slag is non-hazardous and hence, cannot be a pollutant

                and much less a reason for closure of the petitioner's plant. Similarly, gypsum

                is manufactured throughout the country and it is a non-hazardous material and

                the TNPCB takes a stand that it is the hazardous only in the case of the

                petitioner.       If the stand taken by the TNPCB is to be accepted, then all

                fertiliser industries must be closed. Further, as per the guidelines issued by the

                CPCB, storage of gypsum is regulated and unless there is a violation of such

                regulation, the petitioner cannot be penalised.             Furthermore, there is no

                allegation that the petitioner violated the storage regulation.

                reason, CPCB granted time till September 2019 for construction of the pond as

                per the new design. It is submitted that though there was no requirement for

                such a storage pond, which was imposed only in the year 2014, the petitioner

                had constructed a state of art storage pond as early as 1999 and the present

                guidelines is a change of specifications which the petitioner would achieve.

                Further, the learned Senior Counsel submitted as to the effect of non-

                maintenance of gypsum pond on account of disconnection of power supply

                and the consequences which will result, if there is a overflow due to rains and

                there is a likelihood of polluting the groundwater.             Further, the learned

                report destroys the case of the respondents and therefore, they wanted the

                report to be scrapped and failed in their attempt. Thus, it is submitted that

                there is no material to infer pollution and no scientific study has been done by

                the TNPCB and the reasons given for closure, are wholly unsustainable.

                system and this system could not be operated, as the power supply was

                disconnected after issuance of the order of closure. Further, as per the report

                the CPCB guidelines and this report was accepted by the Hon'ble Supreme

                Court and the respondent did not report of any problem till 2018 and therefore,

                the order of closure should not have been passed.

                maintenance and the entire plant will be dismantled and would be put back

                after repairs and maintenance. The TNPCB alleged that on 23.05.2018, the

                petitioner attempted to start production which is impossible, because the entire

                plant was dismantled. On 25.05.2018, i.e., immediately after closure order by

                TNPCB, the petitioner addressed the Chairman, TNPCB pointing out that the

                plant requires serious maintenance, leaks were noticed and if maintenance is

                order passed by the High Court ordering closure and not deciding the

                correctness of an order passed by a regulating agency, the TNPCB.

                Supreme Court and there is a clear observation in the judgment of the Hon'ble

                Supreme Court that the TNPCB can exercise its power. Further, the Hon'ble

                Supreme Court has recorded that the NEERI report of 2005 clearly states that

                there was pollution. Since NEERI had filed the report before the Hon'ble

                Supreme Court stating that 29 out of the 30 directions had been complied with,

                the Unit was permitted to operate. In the said judgment, there is a positive

                affirmation that there was pollution and in spite of imposition of fine of

                Rs.100 crores on the petitioner, it has not had any deterrent effect on them.

                ordered closure based on public protest and to term the action as “malice” in

                guidelines were framed, the petitioner had a state of art facility. Further, there

                was reference to certain orders passed by the TNPCB granting extension of

                time to certain other industries. The argument put forth by the petitioner

                stating that their existing facility was already a state of art facility can hardly

                come to the aid and assistance of the petitioner while seeking to challenge the

                impugned order on the said ground.           The petitioner does not enjoy any

                exemption from the new design, which the CPCB has stipulated.                         The

                petitioner did not apply for grant of additional time to comply with the

                requirement. During 2014, the condition was imposed and five years times

                was granted. Until 31.03.2018, the petitioner did nothing about it. Therefore,

                to state that the same cannot be a reason for rejection of renewal, is untenable.

                powder which is a by-product of the phosphoric acid plant of the petitioner's

                unit. The concentration of metals in this phosphogypsum depends upon the

                composition of the phosphate rock.         Main concerns with respect to

                phosphogypsum includes high fluoride concentration, which may leach and

                contaminate groundwater; heavy metals, which may enter into the food chain;

                disposal mandate for gypsum to avoid accumulation consequently, to avoid

                and control of pollution is by imposing conditions in the consent orders, which

                are meant for substantial compliance, consent orders are time bound and have

                a specific expiry date. Thus, violation of any of the conditions imposed in the

                consent order, would be violation of the provisions of the Act and thus, illegal.

                Thus, it is contended that the petitioner's argument amounts to challenging the

                collective and public welfare, which is to be treated to be a zenith of law. In

                support of such contention, reliance was placed on the decision in the case of

                arguments of the petitioner is that the 2013 judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme

                Court would operate as a res judicata. In this regard, it is submitted that the

                2013 judgment arose out of an order passed by this Court directing closure,

                whereas the present case is, where there is refusal of consent ordered by the

                TNPCB and permanent closure ordered by the Government followed by orders

                by TNPCB. Therefore, the two situations are qualitatively different.

                come into play is the principle set out in the judgment referred above.

                Furthermore, in paragraph 51 of the 2013 judgment, it has been clearly stated

                that the judgment will not stand in the way of the authorities issuing directions

                including 'closure'. Therefore, the argument of the petitioner is a complete

                misreading of the 2013 judgment. Further, the 2013 judgment does not give a

                clean-chit to the petitioner and it is not that the petitioner is a non-polluting

                industry.        So far as the 30 conditions are concerned, it is a continuing

                obligation on the petitioner and on violation of any one of the same, the Board

                is empowered to close down the industry.

                reiterating that power vests with the Board/ State for ordering closure as

                referred above, State has considered the TDS levels in Thoothukudi are higher

                than what is safe and needs to be mitigated and as a preventive measure, the

                State can resort to closure. It is further contended that in this decision-making

                process, it is not necessary that the petitioner alone is the sole cause of high

                TDS level and mere causatory or contributory impact is enough for such an

                However, in the petitioner's case, the TNPCB vide order dated 09.04.2018,

                refused renewal of consent to operate and vide order dated 12.04.2018,

                directed the unit not to resume operation without obtaining prior consent. The

                other order, which was passed subsequently dated 28.05.2018, was due to

                violation of conditions in orders dated 09.04.2018 and 12.04.2018 and it is

                only, vide order dated 28.05.2018, sealing of the petitioner's unit was directed.

                Therefore, this is a factual distinction from that of Gopinath Pvt., Ltd (supra).

                Furthermore, in Gopinath Pvt., Ltd. (supra) the subject matter of impugned

                order was only a small part of its business, unlike the petitioner. Thus, it is

                dumped the same across the district. The condition was imposed for disposal

                of gypsum to avoid accumulation and consequent ground water pollution. The

                accumulated at the premises at the time when the consent was refused. There

                was a specific condition for disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes

                condition by operating without authorisation, not furnishing details of

                authorised recyclers and allowed great accumulation of wastes within the

                premises. The petitioner did not comply with the condition regarding the

                construct the barrier. The petitioner replied on 28.10.2017, stating that slag

                was sold to the land owner, who was getting the land surveyed and on survey,

                would construct a barrier. It is pointed out that survey was done between

                October and December 2017 by the District Administration and there was no

                delay. Independently, the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Thoothukudi, issued a

                notice to the landowner for removal of slag from the river bank, as the same

                restricted the flow of the river and caused floods in the past. The landowner

                sent a reply to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate stating that the land was not

                being measured, but the documents show that the land was measured and

                demarcated. Thus, it is contended that the petitioner was acting in collusion

                with the landowners to delay/defeat the removal of slag from the river belt, as

                despite survey of the land being done within a week on the request of the

                landowner, the slag was not removed and the landowner submitted fresh

                request for survey and the petitioner pleaded helplessness to carry out its

                operations, these facts are deemed to have been admitted by the petitioner.

                The CPCB certification states that slag is a stable non-hazardous solid waste

                and can be used in cement industry etc., cannot be an universal rule, as it

                depends upon the type of slag and whether one exposed to natural causes,

                would it release into environment its polluting components.

                damage caused by the petitioner by indiscriminate dumping across the district

                and in the river belt, is largely irreversible and protection of environment

                that the amendment in the EP Rules in respect of reducing the emission

                standard to 2 kg/tonne was only on 07.05.2008 and this may not be relevant

                for calculating the height of the stack established in 1996 when the expansion

                happened, that is, in 2004 and 2006. It is submitted that TNPCB passed an

                order dated 19.04.2005, restricting the SO2 emission to 1 kg/tonne while

                granting consent. This according to the learned counsel is meant to be over

                and above the design benefits offered by a stack of adequate height

                considering the toxicity of SO2 and increased industrialisation in Thoothukudi.

                Therefore, it is submitted that this emission factor of 1 kg/tonne should not be

                used for calculating the stack height, as stack height can be calculated only as

                closure of the factory, assumes importance and the same was obtained.

                Likewise, the data obtained from the CAC for the period 2015 to 2018 showed

                that the values of pollutants as recorded by the meters stayed constant for

                varying periods of time and apart from that, very low and unrealistic readings

                were recorded. This will go to show that the actual ambient air quality in the

                analysis of concentrate once in every eight hours for heavy metals was

                directed, but no such report has been furnished. The consent order further

                prescribes yearly environmental audit focussing on mass balance for all

                pollutants. The TNPCB has also directed material, environmental and energy

                audits of the petitioner unit, however, the same have not been conducted or

                submitted to this Court. On 14.09.2005 show cause notice was issued to the

                details, it is submitted that if measured concentration of a contaminant in a

                waste stream is less than the lower end of the range, it indicates inefficient

                pollution control process that fails to remove the contaminants from the

                concentration of a contaminant in a waste stream is higher than the higher end

                of the range, it renders the waste stream too contaminated to be permitted to be

                readings in the displays at CAC, TNPCB recorded very high levels as high as

                1123.6 PPM and the wind direction at the relevant time was from West North-

                west to East South-east with the speed of 1.22 km/hour. The direction was

                towards the densely populated Thoothukudi town which is around 4kms from

                the petitioner unit and about 9kms from the coast. Further, the petitioner's

                AAQ monitored at SIIL colony recorded increased SO2 level starting at

                2.50am when the reading was 10ug/Nm3 to about 40ug/Nm3 by 3.50am and

                thereafter, there is a declining trend until 5.50am, but the levels remain at

                &gt;20ug/Nm3 – higher than the reading at 2.50am.           Between 5.50am and

                6.05am, the online monitor in SIIL Colony registers a spike at about

                60ug/Nm3 and the data from this monitor is only available up to 10.05am. By

                false because calibration ought to have been done before start-up, but the

                petitioner claims to have started calibration only after initiating the Sulphuric

                Acid plant's blower at 12.50 am on 23.03.2013; calibration was not a

                continuous process; the increase in emission level on 23.03.2013 has been

                gradual and not sudden. However, during calibration, zero gas is introduced

                and then one zero value is recorded, span gas will be introduced to check

                reading in the analyser and once the limited span gas introduced passes

                through the analyser, the levels will drop suddenly. This was shown to have

                been done during the calibration conducted by the petitioner industry on

                27.04.2013 in the presence of the members of NGT. The AAQ stations at

                Sterlite colony recorded increase in SO2 level, which indicates an increase in

                SO2 concentration in ambient air. Therefore, the wind direction at the time

                was towards Thoothukudi and complaints of the people were reported. Thus,

                it is submitted that on 23.03.2013, the petitioner had emitted unknown

                quantum of SO2 gas and this is more so because the monitor choked at 11.23

                cleaning cake is expected to be generated at the rate of 14 to 32 TPD. The

                petitioner's production was restricted to 40,000 TPA and the quantum of ETP

                cake that should have been generated based on the design rate in the rapid EIA

                report is 0.1278 tonnes per tonne of copper anode and for 40,000 TPA, it will

                be 5,112 TPA. In addition to the above, the gas cleaning cake should also be

                caused by the petitioner is extensive and if allowed to function, it would be a

                of protest to be conducted on 22.05.2018 was given; on 18.05.2018, the

                There are 150 red category industries in the State of Tamil Nadu, which have

                Assuming all the allegations in the impugned orders are true, yet there is no

                allegation of pollution. It is submitted that all the decisions referred to and

                relied on by the respondents presuppose pollution, which is not the case of the

                of closure, does not anywhere indicate nor allege that the petitioner is a

                chronic polluter. Thus, if the factual matrix does not made out a case of

                found or used. The power conferred on TNPCB to prohibit is only for a new

                industry and not in respect of an industry which is functioning. Further, the

                words “permanent closure” are not found in the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_342">Water Act</a> or the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_343">Air Act</a>.

                spite of all these, TNPCB cannot argue that still it would be hazardous under

                from the schedule, it would mean that it is non-hazardous and it is not an

                exemption from the provisions of the Act.

                a reason for closure of the unit. Compared to the other copper smelting plants

                in the Country such as Hindustan Copper, Birla Copper, etc., the petitioner has

                the latest state of art technology in the country and there is no justification for

                closure of the petitioner's unit.

                alleged past incident. This is more so because, there is no allegation made by

                TNPCB of any recurrence of such incident.

                Further, Article 48A of the Constitution cannot be pressed into service, when

                was made to Rule 10(1)(a)(ii) of the Transaction of Business Rules to submit

                that the impugned Government Order cannot be treated as a policy decision.

                In this regard, it is submitted that the decision in the case M.P.Oil Extraction

                relied on by the respondents is distinguishable. To emphasis his submissions,

                where there was a policy of disinvestment and the decision of the Government

                to a policy of disinvestment was subject matter of challenge and hence, the

                Apex Court held it cannot interfere with a policy decision. Thus, by applying

                the tests in paragraph 57 of the Balco Employees' Union's case, it will be

                clear that there is no policy decision while passing the impugned Government

                Order.

                original decision taken in 1994 to permit the petitioner to establish the unit

                was a policy decision, then without a policy decision, the petitioner cannot be

                closed down. With regard to a single person legislation, the learned Senior

                Counsel referred to the decision in S.P.Mittal. In the said decision, several

                considerations were taken note of, Auroville was treated as a class apart.

                Therefore, it is submitted that there are no special circumstances brought out

                by the respondents to treat the petitioner differently and if so, there should be

                material and there should be application of mind of such material. The statute

                does not create a separate classification within the red category industries and

                the respondents cannot create any sub-classification under the said category.

                That apart, the classification of the industries into various categories such as

                red, orange, etc., has already been done by CPCB and there can be no further

                sub-classification, that too, without consultation with CPCB. Therefore, it is

                clear that the action against the petitioner is clearly discriminatory.

                on 28.02.2018 for authorisation under the HWM Rules. The last date on

                30.04.2018 and all these test reports do not suggest anything against the

                petitioner. Therefore, any subsequent data cannot be given any weightage.

                Further, by referring to the information secured under RIT Act, it is submitted

                that the AAQ monitoring prior to the closure of the petitioner and after closure

                of the petitioner has remained unchanged except particulate matter which has

                The fact that there has been increase in the particulate matter after the closure

                of the petitioner unit would show that the petitioner is not the attributer.         The

                for renewal of consent challenging which, an appeal was filed before the

                Appellate Tribunal in which, TNPCB filed counter raising only five grounds

                44.75m (basic actual emission), which are lower than the actual height of

                60.38m available with the petitioner, which was prescribed by TNPCB. With

                Court is that the petitioner does not possess adequate land for maintaining

                green belt as mandated by TNPCB. Initially, the TNPCB by order dated

                01.08.1994, mandated development of 250m wide green belt.                          This was

                arbitrarily reduced to 25m by order dated 22.05.1995 on a request made by the

                petitioner. The November, 1998 report of NEERI shows that the petitioner

                failed to develop even the reduced extent of green belt. Before the Hon'ble

                Supreme Court, the consideration was only with regard to the correctness of

                the reduction of the size of the green belt to 25m and the Hon'ble Supreme

                Court did not go into the issue of presence or absence of green belt, as there is

                no finding rendered in the 2013 judgment.

                If the green belt had been maintained as alleged, the growth would have been

                substantial and the trees would survive without any maintenance. Further, the

                untrustworthy. The response now sought to be given by the petitioner for the

                with atmosphere/moisture, silicates are formed, which are particulate matter.

                The learned counsel explained the industry pollutant auction ratio.                   With

                regard to the 2013 incident, the learned counsel sought to demonstrate that the

                explanation offered by the petitioner cannot be accepted. It is false to state

                that what was done by the petitioner was in calibration exercise. Merely

                because there has not been any incident after 2013, is no ground to show any

                leniency to the petitioner.       The report of the TNPCB with regard to the

                both sides, as a regulator it has to bear with this. The onus to show that the

                order is valid, is not on TNPCB, but it is for the petitioner to show that it is not

                valid. This is so because, the petitioner is required to take consent to operate

                and on its own, should prevent pollution and the onus is on them to show that

                there is no pollution. After referring to the relevant paragraphs of the 2013

                judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the Court interfered with the order

                because, it was not an order of closure passed by a regulator, viz., the TNPCB

                or the Government. Thus, the subject matter before the Hon'ble Supreme

                Court was not an order of closure by TNPCB. It is submitted that there was an

                argument on behalf of the petitioner that drinking water standards cannot be

                taken into consideration. However, the Hon'ble Supreme Court took note of

                the drinking water standards and therefore, the methodology adopted is

                correct. The Hon'ble Supreme Court found that there was pollution caused by

                the petitioner and the environment was affected. The thirty directions issued

                by TNPCB were based on report/inspection and is a continuing direction and

                Further, it is reiterated that in the 2013 judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme

                Court, what was considered is how a Court should test a public interest

                therefore, there is no pollution, is an incorrect statement. Referring to the

                physico-chemical characteristics of ground water samples, it is submitted that

                the parameters were found to be not complying with drinking water standards.

                The baseline, which has been referred to by the petitioner is of no relevance,

                as the Hon'ble Supreme Court tested the parameters as against drinking water

                standards and therefore, the petitioner cannot rely on the baseline data, nor

                they can make an argument that drinking water standards cannot be taken.

                Referring to a charge contained in page 2 of Volume-R2 filed by TNPCB, it is

                submitted that there is no improvement between 2011 and till date, and 2013

                till date. In fact, figures show that the position has worsened. Therefore, any

                remedial measure will not yield results and the only solution is to close down

                the plant permanently. The details in the chart show that all parameters are

                yet it was contended that it is not a policy decision in the sense it is being

                projected. Taking note of the said submission, Mr.C.A.Sundaram, learned

                Senior Counsel submitted that the if the respondent-Government state that the

                impugned Government Order is in exercise of a statutory power, then his

                There has been no verification done by TNPCB before granting renewal.

                continued pollution.    It is further submitted that renewal of consent was

                14.07.2016, the District Collector addressed the petitioner to remove the slag,

                which was dumped. No action was taken by the authorities to enforce the

                order which would clearly show that the District Administration was in

                connivance with the petitioner. On 24.09.2016, a review meeting was called

                issued. However, no action was taken and the petitioner is habitual polluter.

                taken place prior to the decision of the Hon’ble Apex Court dated 02.04.2013,

                cannot be looked into and cannot be referred to by the TNPCB or for that

                matter the Court. The petitioner pleads that if the respondents are permitted to

                do so, it will be clearly hit by the principles of res judicata. Thus, the

                argument of the petitioner appears to be that after the decision of the Hon’ble

                Supreme Court dated 02.04.2013, by which the judgment of the Division

                Bench of this Court directing closure of the petitioner was set aside and the

                petitioner was permitted to resume production, directed to pay a sum of

                Rs.100 Crores as compensation for the damage caused by them to the

                environment, none of the incidents or events which occurred prior to

                02.04.2013 can be referred to, to pass an order sealing and permanently

                closing the petitioner’s unit. Therefore, before considering the correctness of

                the orders impugned in these writ petitions, we need to steer clear as to

                whether the events, which took place prior to 02.04.2013, are still be germane;

                whether the TNPCB/Government are entitled to refer to and take note of the

                events which took place prior to the said date. To find an answer to this

                question, we need to take note of the nature of reliefs sought for in those cases,

                which ultimately were dealt with by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the judgment

                dated 02.04.2013. Several writ petitions were filed before the Division Bench

                of this Court and the earliest of which being, a writ petition filed in the year

                1996. These writ petitions were filed challenging the environmental clearance

                granted by MoEF and, the consent orders issued under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_395">Air Act</a> and the

                <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_396">Water Act</a> by TNPCB. The 1996 writ petitioner was a voluntary body. The

                other writ petitions were also Public Interest Litigations with varied prayers

                and all of them essentially wanted the petitioner-industry to be closed once for

                all. The Division Bench, by common judgment and order dated 28.09.2010,

                allowed the same with a direction to the petitioner to close down its plant. It

                further declared that the employees of the petitioner would be entitled to

                prohibited distance of 25kms from an ecologically sensitive area, as it is

                within 25kms from 4 of the 21 Islands in the Gulf of Mannar. That no public

                hearing was conducted before grant of environmental clearance by the MoEF.

                The Division Bench held that there was undue haste on the part of the

                battery limit of the industry, which was contemplated under the environmental

                management plan, but subsequently based on a representation given by the

                monthly generated quantity of both slag and gypsum, they were not complied

                Government to grant environmental clearance to the plant of the petitioner

                could only be tested on the anvil of well recognised principles of judicial

                review. After noting a few decisions on the said point, the Court observed that

                the well-recognised        principles   of   judicial   review      are    under      three

                Division Bench of the High Court while exercising power of judicial review

                had exceeded the well-recognised principles and circumstances of judicial

                review. Accordingly, it held that conduct of public hearing prior to grant of

                environmental clearance was not mandatory and hence, the High Court could

                not have interfered with the order granting environmental clearance.

                was no material placed to show that the grant of environmental clearance was

                wholly irrational and frustrated the very purpose of the EIA notification dated

                27.01.1994. Noting that in several cases it was held that it is not for the Courts

                to decide what projects are to be authorised, but as long as they follow the

                statutory process, it is for the responsible authority.          With regard to the

                location of the industry, within the prohibited distance from ecologically

                sensitive area, it was pointed out that the petitioner’s plant is situated in

                S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_403">IPC</a>OT industrial complex and the condition imposed in the consent to

                establish was made without noticing that the industrial complex is within

                25kms of ecologically sensitive area and hence, the High Court was wrong in

                saying that the petitioner had violated the condition.

                Further, it was pointed out that as and when the Central Government issues an

                order under Rule 5 of the EP Rules, appropriate steps may have to be taken by

                and High Court merely stated that TNPCB was generous to the petitioner and

                decision of the authorities. After making such an observation, the Hon’ble

                the petitioner industry to protect the environment.         The Hon'ble Supreme

                Court then, proceeded to examine whether there were materials before the

                whether there were no remedial measures other than the closure of the industry

                of the petitioner to protect the environment. The Hon’ble Supreme Court

                noted that the Division Bench of the High Court had relied on the report of

                NEERI of 2005. After extracting the relevant finding in the said report, it was

                noted that the report of NEERI of 2005 shows emission and effluent discharge,

                which have affected environment, but, however, pointed out that the report

                read as a whole does not warrant a conclusion that the plant of the petitioner

                could not possibly take remedial steps to improve the environment and that the

                only remedy to protect the environment was to direct closure of the plant of

                the petitioner.        Thereafter, the Hon’ble Supreme Court took note of the

                directions issued earlier directing a joint inspection by NEERI with officials of

                CPCB and TNPCB, the report submitted by NEERI, synopsis of TNPCB

                specifying the deficiency and the submission of the petitioner that they have

                removed the deficiency, etc. After taking note of the joint inspection report, it

                was pointed out that out of 30 directions, the petitioner has complied with 29

                directions and only one more direction under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_410">Air Act</a> was to be complied

                with.        Thus, it was pointed out that the deficiencies in the plant of the

                petitioner, which affected the environment as mentioned by NEERI, have been

                removed and therefore, the order of the High Court directing closure of the

                plant is liable to be set aside. After coming to such a conclusion, the Hon’ble

                Supreme Court proceeded to consider the contention on behalf of the

                intervenor that the petitioner was liable to pay compensation for the damage

                caused by them to the environment. After taking note of the NEERI reports of

                1998, 1999, 2003 and 2005, the Hon’ble Supreme Court pointed out that the

                petitioner did pollute the environment through emission, which did not

                confirm to the standards laid down by TNPCB under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_411">Air Act</a> and through

                discharge of effluent, which did not confirm to the standards laid down by

                TNPCB under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_412">Water Act</a>. It was noted, TNPCB did not renew the consent

                to operate for considerable period, yet the petitioner continued to operate its

                plant without such renewal. Thus, for the damages caused to the environment

                fairly long period, the petitioner would liable to compensate by paying

                damages. After having held so, the Court proceeded to determine the quantum

                of compensation payable for which, it took note of the magnitude and capacity

                of the petitioner and made the petitioner liable for a compensation of Rs.100

                Crores and issued direction as to how the money is to be utilised.

                the petitioner and the other persons, who are indirectly employed. Thus, a

                reading of paragraph 48 of the judgment would show that the relief granted to

                the petitioner was not on the ground that Rs.100 Crores was directed to be paid

                as compensation, but for other reasons noted in the said paragraph. Paragraph

                49 of the judgment pays encomium to the writ petitioners before the High

                Court and the intervenor before the Hon’ble Supreme Court for having taken

                up the cause of environment both before the High Court and the Hon’ble

                Supreme Court and for having assisted the Court on all dates of hearing with

                utmost sincerity and hard work. The Hon’ble Supreme Court pointed out that

                very few would venture to litigate for the cause of environment, particularly

                against the mighty and the resourceful, but the writ petitioner before the High

                Court and the intervenor before the Hon’ble Supreme Court not only ventured,

                but also put in their best for the cause of the general public.

                the Hon’ble Supreme Court in paragraph 49. Firstly, the effort of the writ

                petitioner before the High Court and the intervenor before the Supreme Court

                was appreciated. Secondly, the Hon’ble Supreme Court was conscious of the

                fact that the petitioner is mighty and resourceful and it will not be an easy task,

                rather an uphill task for the writ petitioner before the High Court to litigate for

                the cause of environment against the mighty and resourceful petitioner.




</p><p id="p_555">                               294.Paragraph 50 of the judgment is a clear indicator as to what the

                Hon’ble Supreme Court had to say in the matter and a careful reading of the

                said paragraph will give an answer to the question framed by us. By way of

                repetition, it is pointed out that the petitioner seeks to apply the principle of

                “washing off”, which is normally applied in service law jurisprudence. It is

                argued by the petitioner that they having paid Rs.100 Crores of compensation,

                none of the incidents, which were subject matter of the earlier round of

                litigation, can be looked into to assess as to whether the petitioner has to be

                closed down and sealed permanently.

</p><p id="p_557">                               295.The first sentence of paragraph 50 shows that the appeals filed

                by the petitioner were allowed and the judgment of the Division Bench of the

                High Court was set aside consequence thereof, would be the order of closure

                stood revoked. The last sentence of paragraph 50 is very crucial wherein, the

                Hon’ble Supreme Court has made it clear that the judgment will not stand in

                the way of TNPCB issuing directions to the petitioner including a direction for

                closure of the plant, for protection of the environment in accordance with law.

                Therefore, in our considered view and proper understanding, the theory of

                “washing off” cannot be applied to the case on hand. The judgment of the

                Hon’ble Supreme Court, more particularly, the observations in paragraphs 42

                and 45 clearly show that the petitioner did pollute the environment, violated

                the orders of consent, operated the plant for a considerable period of time

                without valid consent, etc.           Therefore, to state that on payment of

                compensation of Rs.100 Crores, all the past misconducts stood wiped off is an

                argument, which is stated to be out rightly rejected as fallacious.

                will show that the appeals were allowed on the ground that the Division Bench

                of the High Court while setting aside the order of environment clearance and

                consents granted to the petitioner, transgressed the well-recognised principles

                of judicial review.           In no part of the decision, the petitioner has been

                exonerated.            The fact that the unit is within the prohibited distance of

                ecologically sensitive area, has been affirmed. The relief, the petitioner gets is

                on account of a technicality because notification is yet to be issued declaring

                the Gulf of Mannar as a National Park, though recommendation has been

                made as early as on 30.04.2003. It is not clear as to why the State of Tamil

                Nadu is sitting tight on the proposal, are there any hidden beneficiaries who

                would benefit by delaying the publication of the notification. Conscious of the

                factual position, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has pointed out, if notification is

                issued, the petitioner has to shift.

                of environmental clearance, the petitioner has been granted relief because, the

                mandatory public hearing condition was introduced by way of an amendment

                in 1997, but by then in the year 1995, the petitioner has been granted

                environmental clearance. However, in the recent decisions of the various High

                Courts including this Court, it has been held that whether conduct of public

                hearing prior to the grant of environmental clearance is mandatory or

                directory, depends upon facts of each case or the magnitude of the impact that

                would be caused on environment, if a particular industry is granted

                environmental clearance. Therefore, in our considered view, the petitioner

                exonerated.

                Hon’ble Supreme Court held that if the report is read as a whole, it does not

                warrant a conclusion that the plant of the petitioner could not possibly take

                remedial steps. Therefore, to state that there was a “clean chit” granted to the

                petitioner would be a statement, which is contrary to facts. Thus, taking note

                of all these factors, the Hon’ble Supreme Court had made the observations in

                paragraph 50, as pointed out earlier. Apart from that, the Court also noted

                that the petitioner is guilty of mis-representation and suppression of material

                fact in the Special Leave Petition and while obtaining interim orders, however,

                did not deny relief to the petitioner bearing in mind the plight of its employees

                and others. Therefore, the petitioner has not been exonerated by the Hon’ble

                Supreme Court and payment of Rs.100 Crores does not wipe away the earlier

                deficiencies, violations, etc., and it will be well open to the respondents to

                refer to them while taking a final decision in the matter, regarding permanent

                closure.

                delivered its verdict. On facts, we have found that the said contention is not

                acceptable and we have given our reasons for the same.                    In Forward

                Construction Co., the question arose as to whether the subject writ petition is

                barred by res judicata, which plea was rejected by the High Court primarily

                for two reasons.       Firstly, in the earlier writ petition, the validity of the

                permission granted under the Development Control Rules, was not an issue

                and secondly, the earlier writ petition was not a bona fide one. The Hon'ble

                Supreme Court, on facts, held that the High Court was not right in holding that

                the earlier judgment would not operate as res judicata. One of the grounds

                taken in the present petition was conspicuous by its absence in the earlier

                petition. It further held that an adjudication is conclusive and final not only as

                to the actual matter determined, but as to every other matter which the parties

                might and ought to have litigated and have had it decided as incidental to or

                essentially connected with the subject matter of the litigation and every matter

                coming within the legitimate purview of original action both in respect of the

                matters of claim or defence. On the second issue as to whether the earlier writ

                petition was lacking in bona fides, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that in

                view of Explanation (vi) to Section 11 of CPC, it cannot be disputed that

                <a href="/doc/921478/" id="a_414">Section 11</a> applies to public interest litigation as well, but it must be proved

                that the previous litigation was the public interest litigation not by way of

                H.T.Somashekar Reddy judgment and the claims and arguments in the

                appeals before the Hon'ble Supreme Court were substantially the same and

                therefore, the judgment in H.T.Somashekar Reddy operates as res judicata.

                The said decision is wholly distinguishable on facts.

                are in question may lose much of its validity. It was further held that the rule

                of res judicata as indicated in Section 11 of CPC has no doubt some technical

                aspects, for instance, the rule of constructive res judicata may be said to be

                technical but the basis on which the said rule rests is founded on consideration

                of public policy. It was further held that it is in the interest of the public at

                large that a finality should attach to the binding decision pronounced by

                Courts of competent jurisdiction and it is also in public interest that individual

                Nevertheless, the Hon'ble Supreme Court thought fit to grant liberty to the

                petitioner to remedy and therefore, permitted reopening of the plant subject to

                fulfilment of conditions. There was no complete exoneration of the petitioner

                of the damage caused. Therefore, the question of the petitioner being vexed

                twice would not arise. Therefore, the decision in the case of Daryao does not

                assist the case of the petitioner, equally so, the decision in Amalgamated Coal

                Fields Limited in which, the decision in the case of Daryao has been referred.

                Therefore, in our considered view, the decisions referred to by the learned

                Senior Counsel for the petitioner as referred supra are all factually

                distinguishable and the plea of constructive res judicata or res judicata would

                considering the plea of res judicata and its applicability to the public interest

                litigation, the Hon'ble Supreme Court pointed out that every technicality in the

                procedural law is not available as a defence when a matter of great importance

                is for consideration before the Court. Even if it is said that there was a final

                by the Hon'ble Supreme Court stating that the industry is located within the

                prescribed distance of an ecologically sensitive location. While dealing with

                this issue, we noted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court did not reject the

                contention but observed that in the event a notification is issued by the

                Government, the petitioner would have to vacate. We had expressed our

                surprise as to why notification has not been issued by the State Government

                and        hazardous use zone'.   There appears to be no dispute on the said

                contention, as the Government in G.O.Ms.No.1730 dated 24.07.1974, while

                mentioning about the permitted usage of various zones, designated 'special

                industrial and hazardous use zone' for industries which are involved in

                Consequently, the petitioner cannot question its applicability. The resultant

                conclusion to be drawn is that the petitioner being a red category industry

                generating hazardous substances cannot be located in any other location

                except in 'special industrial and hazardous use zone'. If such is the factual

                position, the question to be considered is whether the industrial complex in

                which the petitioner industry is in existence could have permitted the

                petitioner industry of such magnitude producing toxic and hazardous

                substances. The answer to the question should be that the petitioner could not

                have been permitted to establish a red category industry in a 'general industrial

                use zone' or in an 'agriculture use zone'.

                (for brevity the “1971 Act”). A change in the Master Plan or a detailed

                development plan involves rigorous procedure and the persons in the locality

                are entitled to be heard before such reclassification is done. It is more a

                serious matter if an agricultural use zone is converted into an industrial use

                zone.

                reclassification. The respondent-State has not placed any document before us

                convince this Court that the petitioner is located in a land which is properly

                for the petitioner is a communication from the Member Secretary (Incharge),

                Local Planning Authority, Thoothukudi to the Commissioner, Town Planning,

                Chennai dated November, 2014. The said communication is pertaining to the

                application filed by the petitioner for putting up construction in the land

                allotted to them. Interestingly, there is a clear reference to the classification of

                the land as it stood on the date of allotment in favour of the petitioner. The

                classification of the land is 'general industrial' as per the revised approval plan

                in LP/DTCP.245/2001. The other details mentioned in the communication

                may not be relevant, as it pertains to the type of construction which the

                petitioner proposed to undertake. However, the said communication notes the

                fact that several objections have been received against the petitioner and they

                are all pending.        Further, the communication mentions that an additional

                extent which has been allotted to the petitioner is from the general industrial

                use zone and controlled industrial use zone. In the details of Master Plan,

                Thoothukudi which was placed before us, we find that in Meelavittan Village

                there is no controlled industrial use zone. Even assuming that a portion of the

                general industrial use zone was converted as controlled industrial use zone,

                then it remains to be seen whether such conversion was legal. Even assuming

                the conversion was legal, it will not in any manner enure in favour of the

                petitioner since the petitioner can be located only in a special industrial and

                hazardous use zone and nowhere else. Therefore, the communication of the

                Member Secretary (Incharge), Local Planning Authority, Thoothukudi does

                not assist the petitioner rather does otherwise.

                includes the land allotted to the petitioner and other red category industries.

                The layout approval has nothing to do with the categorization of industries by

                the Pollution Control Board. It may be true that the land allotted to the

                petitioner forms part of an approved layout. However, that does not improve

                the situation because, unless and until the land is classified as special industrial

                and hazardous use zone, the petitioner cannot be located in the said land and

                S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_431">IPC</a>TO by mentioning the word “Red Category Industry” cannot improve the

                case of the petitioner. Further, the authorities themselves would admit that the

                classified as special industrial and hazardous use zone and most of the red

                category chemical industries are located in general industrial use zone.

                Therefore, it is clear that the petitioner could not have been permitted to locate

                their industry inside the Industrial Complex as it suffers from the zonal

                disqualification. During the course of argument, it was submitted that the

                issue pertaining to the zonation cannot be raised at this distance of time and 20

</p><p id="p_600">                               320.To be noted, the first of the writ petitions filed before this Court

                as Public Interest Litigation, was much prior to the petitioner starting

                commercial production. These writ petitions of the year 1996 questioned the

                grant of environmental clearance. Therefore, the objection for location of the

                industry, which started in 1996, has not died down till date. In fact, the

                Hon'ble Supreme Court in the 2013 judgment appreciated the efforts of the

                public interest litigants and the NGOs with specific reference to the magnitude

                of the petitioner and that very few people would be able to maintain a

                challenge against industries of such magnitude. Therefore, if the location of

                the industry is hit by the zonation notification, there cannot be any via-media

                to the same. That apart, no attempt can be made by the State to now unsettle

                decisions which have dealt with the industries which were located in violation

                of the zoning restrictions as per the Master Plan.

                Supreme Court dealt with industries which discharge highly toxic effluents

                of the Master Plan, but also others who are residents and are using their

                was held that the Master Plan is required to define the various zones into

                which Delhi may be divided for the purposes of development and indicate the

                manner in which the land in each zone is proposed to be used.                      The

                preparation of the zonal development plan provides for proposed land use and

                it also provides that no person shall use or permit to be used any land or

                building otherwise than in conformity with the plan in a zone. Further, it was

                environmental protection considerations, in particular when the State has

                legislated in this regard.   It was further held that the public authorities,

                therefore, assume a responsibility which should in practice result in their

                intervention at the appropriate time in order to ensure that the statutory

                provisions enacted with the purpose of protecting the environment are not

                entirely ineffective. In the said case, action was initiated after twenty seven

                years after the offence was established and the authorities allowed a further

                five years to elapse before instituting criminal proceedings. The Court noted

                Processors CC &amp; Ors., before the High Court of South Africa in Case

                No.9121/2007 dated 11.06.2008, the applicant sought for a declaratory order

                that operation of commercial sawmill on the farm was unlawful. One of the

                arguments by the respondent was that they were singled out by the applicant

                and did not apply the law equally and universally. The Court while rejecting

                the argument, held that the said submission not only amounts to an admission

                of their own illegal conduct, but also without merit.

                [(2007) 4 SCC 211], the question was whether there was fraud played by the

                land owners in collusion with the Port Trust Officers and the land ceiling

                authorities. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that it is well settled principle of

                judgment or order in law, quoting Chief Justice Edward Coke, who

                proclaimed; “Fraud avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical or temporal”. It was

                further held that fraud may be defined as an act of deliberate deception with

                the design of securing some unfair or undeserved benefit by taking undue

                advantage of another. In fraud one gains at the loss of another. It was further

                held that fraud is thus an extrinsic collateral act which vitiates all judicial acts,

                whether in rem or in personam. The principle of 'finality of litigation' cannot

                be stretched to the extent of an absurdity that it can be utilized as an engine of

                oppression by dishonest and fraudulent litigants.

                Supreme Court, noted the conduct of the petitioner and also the extent of land

                held by them and in no uncertain terms stated that it is not conducive to

                consider the petitioner's application for expansion. We have also found that

                the petitioner did not give a straight forward answer to the query raised by the

                MoEF with regard to the actual holding. Therefore, we can safely conclude

                that the act of the petitioner was deliberate as a result of which, they stood to

                gain and it needs to be construed as a deliberate deception and anything

                obtained out of it, should necessarily to be vitiated.

                a State Board only. Therefore, recognising the similar power granted to the

                Central Government under the EP Act, <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_463">Section 33A</a> states direction issued by

                the State Board subject to the direction, if any, of the Central Government and

                this is why the said Section contains a non obstante clause.




</p><p id="p_621">                               332.It is further contended that the fact that the State Government is

                not included in <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_464">Section 33A</a> is owing to the fact that under Section 23 of the

                EP Act, the Central Government has been granted power to delegate its

                function to the State Government, which has been done in the year 1988.

                Therefore, the State Government does not enjoy the power to issue direction

                under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_465">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act, the very same powers have been

                delegated to the State Government under <a href="/doc/791447/" id="a_466">Section 23</a> read with Section 5 of the

                EP Act. Therefore, it is submitted that the State Government can also issue

                direction of closure, but the same would be in exercise of power under the EP

                Act and such power can be exercised after issuing due notice to the industry,

                which may be waived for reasons to be recorded in writing. Therefore, a

                direction issued by the State Government under <a href="/doc/728591/" id="a_467">Section 18(1)(b)</a> of the Water

                Act cannot include a direction under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_468">Section 33A</a>.




</p><p id="p_622">                               333.The contention of the State is that the functions of the Board

                have been distributed among various provisions of the Act and therefore, the

                contention raised by the petitioner is wholly unsustainable.




</p><p id="p_623">                               334.To have a clear picture of the object and intent of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_469">Water Act</a>,

                we need to consider the entire Act as a whole and examine as to whether the

                contentions raised by the petitioner are sustainable.             <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_470">The Water Act</a> was

                amendment to the Act was during 1978 by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_471">Amendment Act</a> 44 of 1978. The

                statement of objects and reasons of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_472">Amendment Act</a> 44 of 1978 states that in

                to the notice of the Government and consequently it has become necessary to

                make certain amendment in the Act. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the statement of

                objects and reasons would be relevant. In paragraph 3, it has been stated that

                certain States are finding it difficult to provide full time Chairman for the State

                Board and therefore, it proposes to amend the Act for appointment of a

                Chairman of the State Board either on full time or on part time depending on

                specific situation. Paragraph 4 of the statement of objects and reasons states

                that there should be an integrated approach for tackling the water and air

                pollution problem and therefore, proposed that the existing Board for the

                prevention and control of water pollution should authorize to perform

                functions relating to the prevention, control and abatement of air pollution.

                The amendment proposed and brought about by Act 44 of 1978 would clearly

                demonstrate that the State envisaged a plan to give requisite effect for

                effective implementation of prevention and control of water pollution. The

                next amendment was in the year 1988 by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_473">Amendment Act</a> 53 of 1988, the Bill

                it has been mentioned that over the past few years (prior to 1988), the

                implementing agency (like TNPCB), have experienced administrative and

                Act</a>.        The ways and means to remove the difficulties were thoroughly

                account the views expressed, it was proposed to amend certain provisions of

                the Act in order to remove such difficulties. Paragraph 3(iii) of the statement

                objects and reasons states that the amendment in the Act is proposed to make

                The duty is to get the real intension and purpose of the legislature and what it

                seeks to achieve. It has to construe the statute as a whole, more particularly in

                Environment Laws.         What is to be seen is the general object which the

                enactment seeks to secure. Therefore, Court has to necessarily examine the

                scope of the statute. The cardinal principle of statutory construction is to save

                and not to destroy.

                would imply that such a direction cannot be in personam.




</p><p id="p_659">                               348.A reading of the impugned Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.72

                shows that the Government under <a href="/doc/728591/" id="a_540">Section 18(1)(b)</a> of the Water Act, in the

                larger public interest, endorsed the closure direction of the TNPCB and also

                directed the TNPCB to seal the unit and close the plant permanently. There

                are three facets to the impugned Government Order. The first of which being,

                it is in exercise of power under <a href="/doc/728591/" id="a_541">Section 18(1)(b)</a> by which, the State

                Government is empowered to issue directions to the State Board, which shall

                be bound by the direction. The second facet is that the Government thought fit

                to invoke such power under <a href="/doc/728591/" id="a_542">Section 18(1)(b)</a> in larger public interest and

                precisely for such reason, in paragraph 2 of the impugned Government Order,

                <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_543">Article 48A</a> of the Constitution was referred to where under, the State shall

                endeavour to protect and improve the environment. The third facet has two

                limbs to it.           The first of which being, a direction endorsing the closure

                direction of TNPCB. The second is a direction of the State Government to the

                TNPCB to seal the unit and close the plant permanently. Therefore, to state

                that the power under <a href="/doc/728591/" id="a_544">Section 18(1)(b)</a> can be invoked only to issue direction in

                rem and not in personam is an argument, which does not merit acceptance.




</p><p id="p_660">                               349.Another submission made on behalf of the petitioner is that

                before such direction is issued, notice should have been issued to the

                petitioner. The petitioner applied for renewal of consent to operate the copper

                smelter plant. An inspection was conducted and report was submitted by the

                Joint Chief Environmental Engineer, Tirunelveli, dated 27.02.2018, who had

                noticed that the petitioner had defaulted in compliance of certain earlier

                directions.        Therefore, the Board rejected the application for renewal of

                consent.

</p><p id="p_662">                               350.The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner

                prefaced his submissions by contending that the order rejecting the application

                for renewal of consent was without notice to the petitioner and is in violation

                of the principles of natural justice, however, added a caveat by stating that

                without giving up such plea, the petitioner requests the Court to adjudicate the

                correctness of the impugned order on merits. Thus, the petitioner seeks for an

                adjudication on merits, hence it may not be necessary for us to elaborate on

                whether the order suffers from violation of principles of natural justice and

                whether the petitioner was entitled to a notice and opportunity before the

                impugned orders were passed etc.




</p><p id="p_663">                               351.The other argument was that an order under <a href="/doc/728591/" id="a_545">Section 18(1)(b)</a> is

                not an appealable order and therefore, it is clear that such direction can be only

                in rem. This argument is also not tenable for the reason that the direction

                issued by the State Government is to the TNPCB endorsing the order of

                closure passed by TNPCB, which is a direction, which can be issued by the

                TNPCB in exercise of power under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_546">Section 33A</a>. After the Government Order

                in G.O.Ms.No.72 was passed, TNPCB has passed an order under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_547">Sections 33A</a>

                and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_548">31A</a> of the Water Act/<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_549">Air Act</a> dated 28.05.2018, which order is an

                appealable order. Therefore, the argument that direction can be issued under

                <a href="/doc/728591/" id="a_550">Section 18(1)(b)</a> only in rem and not in personam is not tenable. That apart,

                the petitioner has been visited with earlier orders of closure and none of those

                orders were put to challenge by the petitioner on the ground now canvassed

                before us stating that the Board does not have power to issue such a direction

                under <a href="/doc/355304/" id="a_551">Section 17(1)(l)</a>, though it may fully not be right to say that the

                petitioner is estopped from raising such contentions, nevertheless the Court

                can take note of the conduct of the petitioner that the petitioner was aware of

                the legal position and precisely for such reason, such contention was not raised

                at any earlier point of time, when closure orders were passed. Thus, for the

                above reasons, it is held that the impugned Government Order does not suffer

                Board'. Sub-Clause (f) of <a href="/doc/673004/" id="a_556">Section 17(1)</a> states that subject to the provisions of

                the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_557">Water Act</a>, a State Board shall inspect sewage or trade effluents, works and

                plants for the treatment of sewage and trade effluents and to review plans,

                specifications or other data relating to plants setup for the treatment of water,

                works for the purification thereof and the system for the disposal of sewage or

                trade effluents or in connection with the grant of any consent as required under

                the Act. <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_558">Section 2(k)</a> defines “trade effluent” to include any liquid, gaseous or

                solid substance which is discharged from any premises used for carrying on

                careful reading of <a href="/doc/1964659/" id="a_559">Section 17(1)(f)</a> would show that it confers power on the

                Board to cause inspection not only the trade effluents, works and plants for

                treatment of sewage for its efficiency but also in connection with the grant of

                any consent as required under the Act. Thus, reading of Sections 17(1)(f) and

</p><p id="p_665">                (l) would clearly indicate that the TNPCB has got power to cause inspection in

                connection with the grant of consent and may vary or revoke any order or

                consent which can be a consent to establish or a consent to operate. Further,

                <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_560">Section 24</a> of the Water Act would also be a relevant provision. The said

                provision deals with prohibition on use of stream or well for disposal of

                polluting matter, etc. <a href="/doc/340671/" id="a_561">Section 24(1)</a> states that subject to the provisions of the

                said Section, no person shall knowingly cause or permit any pollution. The

                mandate of the statute as rightly submitted by the learned Senior Counsel for

                the TNPCB, is a command, a duty cast upon the industry or the person.

                Therefore, the petitioner cannot wriggle out of the rigour of the statute. This

                aspect is amplified, if <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_562">Section 25</a> is taken note of. <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_563">Section 25</a> deals with

                the previous consent of the State Board, establish or take any steps to establish

                any industry, operation or process, etc. Therefore, the petitioner cannot claim

                that they have a right to establish a polluting industry. There is no such right

                conferred on the petitioner, much less a fundamental right. Sub-section (4) of

                <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_565">Section 25</a> deals with the power of the State Board with regard to the power to

                impose conditions while granting consent under <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_566">Section 25(1)</a> which states

                that the State Board may grant its consent, subject to such condition as it may

                impose and the rigour of the said provision is further amplified, if we peruse

                sub-Clauses (i) to (iii) in <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_567">Section 25(4)(a)</a>. In terms of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_568">Section 25(4)(b)</a>, the

                State Board is entitled to refuse consent for reasons to be recorded in writing.

                The condition that may be imposed would vary depending upon the type of

                activity done by the concerned industry. The said conditions are binding on

                the industry.

                evolved by various decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court which had come

                these principles to the cases on hand. The second reason as to why these

                principles have to be applied is on account of the directions issues by the

                Hon’ble Supreme Court to decide the correctness of the order rejecting the

                to operate is not final since upon compliance of the condition imposed, the

                nothing on record to show such inspection and assuming that there was such

                inspections, the alleged inspection report dated 23.05.2018 does not render any

                directions for closure, prohibition, etc., so as to ensure that prompt action

                could be taken to tackle any emergency. The Board after careful examination,

                vide resolution dated 24.02.1994 decided to delegate powers to the Chairman

                under <a href="/doc/1662929/" id="a_622">Section 12</a>(3-B) of the Water Act and to issue directions under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_623">Section

                what weighed in the mind of the Board to decide to delegate its powers to the

                Chairman was to tackle emergent situations. Though certain paragraphs of the

                neither conditional nor any limitation has been imposed.             Therefore, the

                learned Advocate General is right in his submission that the delegation made

                by the Board to its Chairman by invoking power under <a href="/doc/1662929/" id="a_629">Section 12</a>(3-B) is an

                absolute delegation though the Board proceedings sets out certain background

                facts . Therefore, we do not agree with the submission of the learned senior

                counsel for the petitioner that the Chairman can exercise his powers under

                <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_630">Section 33A</a>/<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_631">Section 31A</a> only under emergent situation.              That apart, the

                delegation has been made in favour of the Chairman as could be seen is a

                general delegation and has been in vogue ever since 1994. Therefore, the

                argument put forth by the petitioner stands rejected.

</p><p id="p_682">                               361.The   Board   by   order   dated   09.04.2018,        impugned        in

                W.P.No.5772 of 2019, rejected the application for grant of renewal of consent

                to operate. In the said order, it has been pointed out that the petitioner has not

                complied with five conditions imposed in the previous renewal order. One of

                the reasons set out is on account of the petitioner not removing the copper slag

                dumped/stored along with the river Uppar and patta land, thereby obstructing

                the water course. Further, the petitioner had not constructed any physical

                barrier between river Uppar and slag land fill area of patta land so as to

                prevent the slag from reaching the river. The contentions advanced on behalf

                of the petitioner are two fold. Firstly that the copper slag is non hazardous and

                to substantiate the said contention, the petitioner refers to the slag taken by the

                CPCB, TNPCB and MoEF. It is submitted that the TNPCB permits sale of

                copper slag to private parties and pursuant to which the petitioner had entered

                into an agreement with a private party and sold the slag which is well within

                the knowledge of TNPCB. It is submitted that the slag purchased by the

                private party is stored in his patta land over which the petitioner has no

                control, that is why the District Administration and the TNPCB took action

                against the private party who purchased the slag. In spite of this being the

                factual position and the slag is stored in a land which is not owned by the

                petitioner but by the private party/purchaser, the petitioner took steps to erect a

                physical barrier. It is submitted that the slag is an inert material, it is non

                hazardous and the petitioner had not violated condition No.11 of the consent

                order dated 07.09.2017. The place where the slag has been stored by the

                private party is about 10kms away from the factory and the petitioner cannot

                be said to have violated the condition imposed in the consent order.

                posing threat to the human life and property and the petitioner was directed to

                clear the dumped copper slag from the said lands immediately. The petitioner

                sent a reply dated 26.07.2016 stating that the buyer was solely responsible to

                spread the copper slag in such a way that it must not obstruct free flow of

                water. After reiterating their stand, the petitioner stated that since they have

                sold and supplied the copper slag on ex-work basis to the buyer, they have

                pursued the matter with the buyer for satisfactorily addressing the concern.

                Further, it was pointed out that the TNPCB and the CPCB have permitted to

                use the copper slag in the land fill and no further approval is required.,

                however, as a responsible corporate, the petitioner will provide the details of

                copper slag disposed every month to the TNPCB.              With this stand, the

                petitioner requested that the show cause notice be withdrawn. It is submitted

                that though the private party did not remove the slag, the TNPCB granted

                consent, therefore, the non-renewal of consent vide impugned order dated

</p><p id="p_685">                               363.The first question which needs to be considered is whether

                copper slag is a pollutant, is slag hazardous. To get an answer to this question

                one has to necessarily refer to certain scientific material and publications of

                repute. In fact the submission of TNPCB before the NGT and before the

                Hon’ble Supreme Court earlier is that the slag is hazardous. The petitioner

                contended that TNPCB cannot refer to old reports and the stand taken by them

                is wrong, more particularly, when the HWM Rules has excluded slag from the

                category of hazardous waste.

                contains significant concentration of several potentially toxic elements

                including arsenic, lead, cadmium, barium, zinc and copper. These elements

                can be released into environment under natural weathering condition and

                cause pollution of soils, surface water and ground water. In a research paper

                submitted in the Anna University, it has been stated that copper slag contains

                highly toxic elements like arsenic, barium, cadmium, copper, lead and zinc.

                Copper slag can release these elements into the environment causing pollution

                of soils, atmospheric air, surface water and ground water and copper smelter

                releases copper selenium, they are highly toxic if present over abundant, they

                contaminate soil in the vicinity of smelter, destroying the vegetation. In a

                paper published in Stanford News Survey, it has been stated that the glassy

                material in the slag is the major source of potentially toxic metal release to the

                environment. In a paper published in the National Metallurgical Laboratory

                Journal, Jamshedpur, it has been stated that copper as a metal provides limited

                scope for environmental pollution, but the waste generated by the copper

                granulated slag/slag after copper flotation are dumped near the smelters.

                However, the hazardous constituent in these slags, particularly, selenium,

                mercury, silver, arsenic, lead and copper may enter in the water stream due to

                weathering action and rain water. In a paper, which was published by the

                National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences regarding the other

                copper industries in the Country, namely, Hindustan Copper, KCC, Rajasthan,

                Birla Copper, Gujarat SWIL Limited it has been stated that in the solubility

                test it was found that the sludge [Acid plant sludge] and dusts leaks out

                copper, lead, zinc and cadmium in significant concentration and these sludges

                and dusts are therefore considered potentially hazardous. The petitioner would

                contend that there is uncertainty in the scientific opinion and therefore the

                stand taken by the CPCB that the slag is non-hazardous and is permissible to

                be used for laying roads, levelling, filling up of pits, etc should be taken note

                of and the same cannot be a reason for non-renewal of consent to operate. In

                the earlier round of litigation, which travelled up to the Hon’ble Supreme

                Court, on appeal by the petitioner, in its judgment dated 02.04.2013, the well

                recognized principles of judicial review were set out, which we have noted

                earlier. One among the three grounds on which the High Court could review

                the decision of the authority is on the ground that           the decision was so

                unreasonable so as to suffer from Wednsbury unreasonableness. To be noted

                that the petitioner had sold about 3.5 lakh tonnes of slag, which was stored in a

                private patta land. The huge quantity which was stored had obstructed the

                flow of Uppar river and during rainy season, the Thoothukudi town was

                inundated. The scientific opinion shows that if huge quantity or abundant

                quantities are dumped, it would definitely cause pollution. The scientific

                opinion also shows that copper slag contains highly toxic elements. Therefore,

                to state that the CPCB/TNPCB has permitted certain usages of the slag can

                hardly be a reason to exonerate the petitioner. To be noted that from 2011 to

                December 2017 the petitioner has generated 3915901MT of copper slag and

                they are stated to have disposed of 7437327 MT which includes the old stock.

                It has been reported that copper slag has been dumped in ten places outside the

                premises and the quantity so dumped is 537765 MT. These sites are in

                Thoothukudi District. In such factual scenario, it has to be seen whether the

                petitioner has any responsibility on the slag upon sale of the same to third

                party. To get an answer, we refer to the Memorandum of Understanding and

                Sale Agreement dated 25.09.2010 entered into by the petitioner with one

                Mr.A.Paul. Clause 4 of the Memorandum of Understanding deals with usage

                of copper slag in which the buyer confirms to the petitioner that he will use the

                copper slag for land filling and not for any other purpose, if he does so, he has

                to get written permission from the seller (petitioner).         Further, the buyer

                undertook to the petitioner that he will not sell or dispose of the slag to any

                other third party without the petitioner’s previous permission in writing. The

                buyer was required to ensure compliance of the following instructions for the

                petitioner as the seller cannot disown responsibility. There is a duty cast upon

                them to ensure that the terms and conditions of the Memorandum of

                Understanding are scrupulously followed. The petitioner continues to have

                control over the material and in particular with regard to the manner of usage.

                Thus, if there is violation of the condition, the petitioner is liable to be

                proceeded against. Therefore to state that the liability of the petitioner ceases

                upon sale on ex-works basis is an argument which deserves to be rejected and

                stands rejected. In the instant case, it is evidently clear that though the sale

                took place in 2010 all that the purchaser did was to dump the huge quantity of

                slag in his private patta land did nothing to utilize the same in terms of the

                MoU and the petitioner woke up only after the District Collector issued show

                cause notice on 14.07.2016. The petitioner failed to enforce the terms of the

                MoU for six years for reasons best suited. The facts will clearly show that

                neither the TNPCB nor the District Administration took effective steps to

                abate the nuisance rather the slackness in the approach of TNPCB and the

                District Administration had lead to the flooding of Thoothukudi town on

                account of the obstruction of the river course. The District Administration

                cannot plead ignorance because the quantity of slag dumped is virtually a

                small hillock and visible to any passer-by. Therefore, this Court can safely

                conclude that the officials of the District Administration turned a blind eye to

                the illegality probably unable to do anything considering the magnitude of the

                petitioner. The officials of the TNPCB at the relevant time are also equally

                culpable. What needs to be done to these officers is a matter which requires

                on the Officials/District Administration to go slow, which may also be

                required to be probed to fix responsibility. It is hight time, the Government

                inspection in the surrounding villages to verify the effect on agriculture and

                animal husbandry. The team interacted with the villagers of Meelavittan in the

                Panchayat Village Office, which included senior citizens and women, who

                have expressed their views on issues of environmental pollution by the

                petitioner.       Certain people have complained about increased discharge of

                gaseous emissions during early hours of the day, i.e., around 04.00 am to

                06.00 am during which, they experienced irritation and mild breathing

                discomfort and women complained about itching while using the ground water

                from the borewells of the village. The report records that the problems have

                started after commencement of industrial activity in the area particularly, after

                starting of the petitioner's unit. Further, the villagers have complained that

                the cattle, but also the ground water. The villagers have showed a water body,

                where an open well and a borewell are situated. The villagers stated that the

                village has been using the water for drinking purposes from these

                wells till the year 2002, but after the establishment of the petitioner, the

                discredit the views of the villagers by contending that they were tutored to say

                so. Thus, this report definitely is a material, which should be reckoned to hold

                that the continued operation of the petitioner has affected not only the quality

                of the air in the area, but as well as the ground water. The above conclusion,

                which we had arrived at based on public opinion, should be given due

                credence because, the defaults committed by the petitioner have been

                continuously indicated in various reports more particularly, of NEERI. The

                1999 report of NEERI, which was submitted after an inspection was

                conducted on 17.11.1998, has pointed out the inadequacies in the Effluent

                Treatment Plant (ETP) and stated that the treated effluent quality does not

                confirm to the standards stipulated by the TNPCB and it was over all the ETP.

                The same position continued till May, 2011. In May, 2011 report, apart from

                pointing out inadequacies in the effluent treatment, it was observed that the

                capacity of the evaporation system is inadequate to handle the total quantity of

                rejects generated daily resulting in non-optimal capacity utilisation of the RO

                the inspection conducted by TNPCB during March, 2017, it was pointed out

                that the petitioner has to maintain logbooks for ETPs and has to maintain

                separate logbooks for each ETP.        The petitioner, in their reply dated

                23.03.2017, stated that they are maintaining shift wise logbooks for ETPs in

                electronic form.       The other defect, which was pointed out during the

                inspection such as pin hole leakage in the pipe carrying the treated effluent

                from the ETP to RO, was stated to be repaired immediately. The overflow of

                treated effluent, which was detected during inspection, was admitted by the

                petitioner, but would state that the overflow was immediately corrected. It is

                not clear as to how much was the overflow, was there any data available with

                TNPCB. The inspecting team found that the RO Plant No.3 was not in

                operation. The petitioner admitted the same and stated that they are in the

                initial stages of commissioning RO-3, which will be completed by the end of

                March, 2017.

                been given by CPCB and TNPCB and they have entered into an agreement

                and levelling activities and compacted the same with gravel and enclosed

                prevent slag from reaching river Uppar.       A cumulative reading of the

                additional conditions   mentioned above will show that the petitioner had

                indiscriminately dumped copper slag outside the Unit and in certain patta

                lands. Further, there appears to be excess storage of solid waste slag within

                the Unit thereby compelling TNPCB to stipulate as to the area where the slag

                has to be stored, the stacking height throughout the storage area. Further

                mention of the disposal ratio of 1:1 of gypsum and copper slag will also go to

                show that there was excess stock of production of more than 15 days

                necessitating a condition to be imposed on the petitioner.                   Further,

                responsibility was fixed on the petitioner for indiscriminately dumping copper

                slag near a water course and in patta land and the petitioner was directed to

                construct a physical barrier between the river and the slag land fill so as to

                prevent the slag from reaching the river. The petitioner argues that these are

                new conditions and therefore the same cannot be taken as a ground for closing

                the petitioner Unit. This argument cannot be accepted for the reason that the

                petitioner had violated the conditions stipulated earlier which had compelled

                the TNPCB to issue such additional conditions. We have noted that the

                petitioner's control over the slag continues though it is shown to be sold to a

                private party. Therefore, the petitioner cannot disown its responsibility in the

                safe disposal of slag and the fact that huge quantity of slag was dumped

                indiscriminately adjoining a river will go to show that the petitioner is a

                chronic defaulter. The plea raised by the petitioner that it has been stored in a

                patta land by the purchaser and the petitioner cannot be held responsible as the

                slag was sold on ex-factory basis is an argument which needs to be rejected.

                The slag can be sold subject to stringent conditions and facts clearly

                demonstrate that the purchaser did nothing with the slag though he is said to

                have purchased it for land filling and had kept in an area for several years. To

                be noted that in the consent order dated 22.05.1995 while granting consent for

                establishment under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_633">Section 25</a> of the Water Act, the condition was that the

                sand blasting, for land filling and road building activities then and there to

                avoid accumulation of solid waste within the premises. In the proceedings of

                the District Collector dated 24.09.2016 which was issued when there was

                flooding in the Uppar river, a meeting was convened presided over by the

                District Collector and attended by the revenue officials as well as the top

                executives of the petitioner. In the said proceedings, it has been mentioned

                that near the Pudukottai Bridge in the Uppar river the copper slag has been

                dumped and notice under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_634">Section 133</a> Cr.P.C. has been issued by the Sub-

                apart from desilting the river. Further the petitioner was also directed to co-

                operate. It was argued that obstruction caused on account of the slag to the

                Uppa river is not pollution and therefore, the same cannot be a ground to

                refuse renewal of consent to operate. This argument has to be outrightly

                rejected for the simple reason that if slag has been indiscriminately dumped

                either within the factory premises or in other places in Thoothukudi District,

                the petitioner will be responsible and it would tantamount to violation of

                consent conditions. In other words, slag could not have been dumped in such

                huge quantities and allowed to lie over for nearly a decade, which goes to

                show that slag was not put to use for any beneficial purpose as stipulated in the

                consent conditions. Therefore, obstruction of the river amounts to violation of

                a consent condition and therefore, the petitioner is liable to be proceeded with.

                Apart from that, by obstructing the flow of water in a river or stream resulting

                in flooding and causing other consequences is also a form of pollution.

                Therefore, there is no substance in such contention advanced by the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_708">                               371.We are surprised to note as to why the District Collector in the

                year 2016 directed the Water Resources Organization of the Public Works

                Department to remove the slag when the petitioner was fully responsible. In

                all probabilities the petitioner would have been able to convince the officials

                that they have sold the slag and the purchaser has left it in the patta land.

                Unfortunately, the District Administration did not note the Memorandum of

                Understanding between the petitioner and the purchaser, held the petitioner

                responsible and they cannot divest themselves of the transaction like any other

                sale of goods.          Surprisingly though the Assistant Engineer, TNPCB,

                Thoothukudi was a participant in the meeting, this vital fact was not placed

                before the District Collector in the meeting so as to fix responsibility on the

                petitioner.       What emerges from these facts is that slag which is a waste

                generated during the manufacturing process is required to be stored and

                disposed of in a specified manner. The end usage of the slag cannot be a

                factor to consider whether the petitioner had violated the consent condition or

                not. The end use is totally a different subject. In other words, the order of

                consent permits production of certain products, recognizes certain by-

                products, one of which is slag and directs the slag to be stored in a particular

                manner and disposed of in a particular ratio. The mention in the consent order

                stating that the gypsum and copper slag shall be disposed of for sustainable

                application such as slag blasting, road building activities, cement industries

                and other relevant area of application with approval from concerned agencies.

                The disposal for such sustainable application should be with the approval from

                the concerned agencies. It is not disputed that the purchaser/pattadar, one

                Leelavathy, wife of Thangavel had kept the material stored in her patta land

                and this has obstructed the flow of water in the river and when notice was

                issued under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_635">Section 133</a> Cr.P.C., she agreed to immediately remove the

                copper slag and put a concrete bund to demarcate the boundary.                     The

                undertaking given by Leelavathy and subsequently by the petitioner who later

                on constructed the wall was not to remove the entire quantity of the dumped

                slag but that portion of the slag which obstructed the river. Therefore, the

                petitioner has to be held responsible for obstructing the river course for which

                separate proceedings need to be initiated and the damage caused due to the

                floods should be recoverable from the petitioner. The second aspect which

                flows from this is that the slag continued to remain dumped in the said land

                which is in violation of the consent condition.         We have noted that the

                purchaser, one Mr.Paul appears to be a name lender. Therefore the petitioner

                cannot contend that because the slag was permitted to be disposed of, it is

                inert. That would not be the right test to determine the quality, the leachability

                and the hazardous nature of the substance. The question is did the TNPCB

                verify whether the petitioner had disposed of the slag for sustainable

                development. The facts show that the TNPCB did not examine this aspect

                because had it been done, there cannot be enormous mountain of slag dumped

                in and around Thoothukudi District. Therefore, viewed from any angle it has

                to be held that the petitioner has violated the consent condition and the default

                imposed even in the year 1995 while granting consent to establish and

                prepared by M/s.Vimta Labs Limited for the petitioner for their proposed

                copper smelter plant-II. In table 1.2, in the details of production capacity,

                Available Techniques and Best Environmental Practices, published by the

                United Nations Environment, 2016 while explaining the process of smelting, it

                is stated that because of high temperature, the mercury will be volatilized and

                thus, be present in the exhaust gas and in the exhaust gas, mercury will be

                absorbed on particulate matter or present a soluble mercury compound and

                will also be present as elemental mercury. The oxidised species of mercury

                can normally be removed by using scrubbers and wet electrostatic

                precipitators. Particulate bound oxidised mercury can be removed by bag

                house filters.         Elemental mercury, however passes all such standard gas

                cleaning equipment and therefore, secondary mercury removal stage may be

                needed to reduce the mercury to acceptable concentration, if it is present in the

                ore. The reason elemental mercury cannot be removed from the ambient

                temperature gas stream by scrubbing with water alone is its low solubility in

                water. It is also stated that mercury may also be present in the waste water

                produced by these processes and will require proper storage or management.

                report was carried out at various copper slag landfill sites showing leachability

                of heavy metals present in copper slag in water leachate. Thus, it is the

                submission that the report of soil samples around slag dumps conducted by

                M/s.SGS on behalf of TNPCB without following the rules and conducting a

                total constituent analysis cannot be relied on. The TNPCB is the regulator and

                we have to presume that the regulator knows what is best, but the petitioner

                has been right through projecting that they are adopting better standards. If

                such is their stand, then what they apparently want to do is to regulate the

                regulator, which is not feasible both factually and legally.               Therefore, if

                according to the petitioner whatever tests done by the regulator are wholly

                erroneous or on the other hand, if the procedures adopted by them or the

                procedures that need to be followed as they are as per global specifications,

                then nothing prevented the petitioner from approaching the regulator for a

                special set of condition or exemption. On the other hand, what we found was

                ever since the petitioner commenced production, every order of consent or

                direction issued by the regulator contained the very same directions, which if

                cumulatively considered, would show that there has been continued non-

                compliance. Therefore, we cannot accept the stand taken by the petitioner to

                disregard the reports submitted by TNPCB based on a study conducted by

                M/s.SGS.

                other occasions, where the values remained static for close to 8 hours and in

                more is 7337 for NOx for PM10 it is 7115, for SO2 it is 10692, for PM2.5 it is

                also reference to certain test reports. Thus, we need to first consider the effect

                of the note in Schedule I of the HWM Rules, 2016. It has been stated therein

                that high volume low effect waste such as fly ash, phosphogypsum, red mud,

                slag from pyrometallurgical operations, etc. are excluded from the category of

                hazardous waste. Separate guidelines on the management of these waste shall

                be issued by the CPCB. The argument of the petitioner is that slag having

                been excluded from the category of hazardous waste, it can no longer be

                treated as hazardous. The HWM Rules have been framed in exercise of

                powers under Sections, 6, 8 and 25 of the EP Act.               Rule 3(17) defines

                ‘hazardous waste’ to mean any waste which by reason of characteristics such

                as physical, chemical, biological, reactive, toxic, flammable, explosive or

                corrosive causes danger or is likely to cause danger to health or environment

                whether alone or in contact with other waste or substance and shall include

                waste specified under column 3 of Schedule I. Assuming for the sake of

                argument that the petitioner is right, mere exclusion of slag from Schedule I

                will not take away its character from the definition of hazardous waste under

                Rule 3(17) unless and until it is established that none of the characteristics

                mentioned in this Rule stand attracted. Further <a href="/doc/379900/" id="a_638">Section 2(e)</a> under the EP Act

                defines ‘hazardous substance’ which means any substance by reason of its

                chemical or physico chemical properties or handling is liable to cause harm to

                human beings or other living creatures, plants, micro organisms, property or

                the environment. “Handling” has been defined under <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_639">Section 2(d)</a> which

                includes storage, offering for sale, usage, etc. Therefore, the argument that the

                slag has been removed from the category of hazardous waste in Schedule I can

                in no manner advance the case of the petitioner. Furthermore, the removal

                from Schedule I is conditional as it states separate guidelines will be issued by

                the CPCB.              Therefore, any certification by the regulator be it CPCB or

                TNPCB, it can be construed only for an ideal situation.                    Indiscriminate

                want of additional details and the petitioner had not resubmitted the same. It is

                the submission of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner that in terms of

                Rule 6(1) of the HWM Rules, HW authorization is not a pre-condition for

                obtaining consent to establish or consent to operate. It is further submitted

                that when the impugned order dated 09.04.2018 was passed, the application

                for renewal of the authorization was pending and the petitioner has now filed a

                writ petition for issuance of a writ of Mandamus to direct the respondent to

                renew the authorization. Therefore, it is submitted that non-renewal of the

                HW authorization, cannot be a reason for refusing to renew the consent to

                contention that non-renewal of HW authorization cannot be a ground to refuse

                to renew the consent to operate. The learned senior counsel referred to

                inspection report of the TNPCB for consideration of the renewal of the HW

                authorization and the report of the inspection dated 28.02.2018 and submitted

                that the renewal of the authorization was recommended subject to sixteen

                conditions. Therefore, it is submitted that the reason assigned in paragraph 3

                of the impugned order dated 09.04.2018 is wrong. To examine the correctness

                of the contentions put forth, we need to have a broad over view of the HWM

                Rules. The 2016 Rules superseded the 2008 Rules and the authorization

                initially granted to the petitioner on 10.07.2008 was under the earlier Rules.

                Admittedly, the authorization expired on 09.07.2013. The petitioner’s case is

                that on 25.06.2013, well before the expiry of the authorization the petitioner

                had filed an application for renewal on 25.06.2013 and on the same day, the

                annual return in Form 4 was submitted to the TNPCB. Between November

                2013 and May 2014, the petitioner is stated to have sent reminder letters

                seeking renewal. On 28.05.2014, the renewal application was resubmitted

                with additional details as per the ISO auditors’ observations. The petitioner

                would state that from June 2014, they have been periodically sending reminder

                letters to the TNPCB for renewal of the authorization, simultaneously they

                were submitting their monthly returns.        On 05.07.2016, the petitioner

                submitted an authorization renewal application through the on-line portal to

                the TNPCB as per the 2008 Rules. On 01.09.2016, the TNPCB has informed

                the petitioner that there is some issue in editing the renewal application filed

                under the 2008 Rules and it may take some time to renew the same and

                returned the application and after the industry requests for deletion of the old

                application, the same will be deleted and the industry to apply under the 2016

                Rules. It appears that the said direction was complied with by the petitioner

                and fresh application was submitted under the 2016 Rules thereafter. The

                TNPCB rejected the application on 27.08.2017 and 24.11.2017 for not

                not tallying with old authorization. The petitioner submitted a representation

                on 18.12.2017 followed by resubmitting the renewal application on

                20.12.2017.            On 25.01.2018 additional particulars were called for and

                according to the petitioner, the application was resubmitted on 08.02.2018.

                The TNPCB by order dated 16.04.2018 rejected the application on several

                grounds. On 17.04.2018, the application was resubmitted which was again

                rejected on 05.06.2018 on several grounds. On 18.07.2018, the application

                was resubmitted which was rejected on 26.09.2018 and once again the

                petitioner is stated to have resubmitted its application on 22.12.2018.

                Therefore, the petitioner would contend that when the impugned order

                refusing to renew the consent to operate dated 09.04.2018 was passed, the

                application for renewal of authorization was pending.

                precedent to obtain consent to operate. Rule 3(3) of the 2016 Rules defines

                ‘authorization’ to mean permission for generation, handling, collection, etc., of

                hazardous waste granted under Rule 6(2). Rule 3(10) defines ‘disposal’ to

                mean any operation which does not lead to reuse, recycling, recovery, etc. and

                disposal in secured land fill. As seen earlier, Rule 3(17) defines ‘hazardous

                waste’ which includes waste in column No.3 of Schedule I to the Rules apart

                from other things.     Rule 4 cast a responsibility on the petitioner for

                management of hazardous and other waste. The petitioner is bound to follow

                the steps of prevention, minimization, reuse, recycling, recovery, utilization

                including co-processing and safe disposal. Rule 4(2) mandates the petitioner

                to be responsible for safe and environmentally sound management of

                hazardous and other waste. Rule 5 deals with the responsibility of the State

                an illegality. The fact that authorization was not renewed is a very serious

                matter.        Unfortunately, neither the officials of the TNPCB nor the State

                Government took note of it. As a result of which, the petitioner continued to

                handle and dispose of hazardous and other waste as per their whims and

                The petitioner claims that they have been filing periodic statutory returns in

                Form 3. The dates of submission have been given. It is not clear as to what

                TNPCB did with those returns.               The Court can safely conclude that

                considering the large number of red category industries in the State, there is

                every likelihood that the returns are not processed or processed belatedly. We

                are justified in coming to such conclusion, as there was nothing placed on

                record by TNPCB to show that returns submitted by the petitioner were

                verified for its correctness. In all probabilities, the returns if submitted in

                physical form will be filed in physical form. If it is submitted online, probably

                it is downloaded and filed. There appears to be no analysis of these returns, no

                examination as to whether the petitioner complied with the condition. Thus

                slackness on the part of the officials of the TNPCB who are in-charge of

                ensuring compliance of HWM Rules have failed to discharge their duty. The

                question is whether the magnitude of the petitioner made them to do so. For

                the first time, the TNPCB woke from deep slumber when the application was

                rejected on 27.08.2017 and subsequently on 24.11.2017. From the details

                placed by the petitioner in their typed set of document Volume 2C, we find

                that this is the first time there was a rejection by the TNPCB. This was

                followed by calling for additional particulars on 25.01.2018 followed by

                rejection dated 16.04.2018, 05.06.2018 and 26.09.2018. It is not clear as to

                whether the Department which takes care of implementation of HWM Rules is

                independent of the department of TNPCB which deals with grant of consent

                and renewal of consent to operate. Even assuming there are two Departments,

                they are bound to act in coordination. Thus, considering the scheme of the

                Rules, the purpose for which it was framed under the EP Act, obtaining

                authorization under the Rules is not a formality but it is a mandatory

                requirement as could be seen from the plain language of Rule 6(1). Thus, if

                the application submitted by the petitioner for renewal of authorization has not

                been granted, it is deemed that the application has been rejected because the

                Rule does not contemplate a deemed renewal. This is amply clear from the

                procedure stipulated under Rule 6(2) and (3). An inspection is a pre-requisite

                for grant of authorization and a copy of the inspection report has to be

                appended to the authorization. Therefore, the argument of the petitioner that

                their application was pending could be taken as a defence is a wrong

                understanding of the legal position. TNPCB is also to be blamed because they

                were probably under the impression that it is something like a trade license

                issued by the municipality forgetting the sensitivity and seriousness of

                issuance of such license. The renewal application submitted by the petitioner

                under the 2008 Rules was kept pending and as long as the authorities did not

                initiate any action against the petitioner, they were least concerned and are

                stated to have been submitting their returns as if dropping it in a post box. In

                2016, it appears that the TNPCB wanted the petitioner to withdraw the 2008

                application and resubmit an online application under the 2016 Rules. We have

                noted the dates on which the petitioner had submitted their applications for

                renewal of the authorisation. The respondent Board has furnished the online

                status of the petitioner’s applications for renewal and as to why the application

                was returned from time to time.       Some of the observations made during

                scrutiny are very relevant viz., on 27.08.2017 while returning the application,

                the petitioner was directed to furnish the agreement made with authorised

                recycler for handling hazardous waste for waste category numbers 3.1, 5.1,

                5.2, 7.4, 7.5 and 33.1; secondly, it was pointed out that the waste stream and

                quantity for which authorisation was obtained on 10.07.2008 is not tally with

                the present allegation. The petitioner had resubmitted the application and on

                03.11.2017,            the   same   was   returned     calling       for      additional

                particulars/clarifications viz., that the petitioner should clarify the details of

                hazardous waste mentioned in serial no.9 (category no.5.1), serial no.20

                (category no.5.1), serial no.12 (category no.17.1), serial no.32 (category

                no.17.1) and serial no.15 (category no.33.1) and expired chemicals. From the

                “note of history”, it is seen that for the very same reason, the application stood

                returned several times. The application was returned on 07.03.2018 calling for

                particulars among other things with regard to use of spent oil for authorised

                recycler for recycling and for reuse in smelting operations. The petitioner was

                directed to specifically mention the process where it is recycled etc.

</p><p id="p_734">                               384.On 17.03.2018, an elaborate remark was made by the

                Environmental Engineer wherein among other things, the petitioner was

                directed to clarify the reasons for disposing part of the wastes to on site

                landfill instead of disposing to recyclers.     The petitioner was directed to

                disclose the capacity of the active landfill and its adequacy etc. Thus, the

                application submitted by the petitioner for renewal of its authorisation was

                considered by the authority though belatedly, with due application of mind and

                every time the application was returned, reasons have been set out as to why

                the application is returned and on each such return, the petitioner appears to

                have furnished certain information which was either inadequate or further

                information was required to be furnished upon disclosure of the information

                called for. Therefore, the petitioner cannot take advantage of the fact that their

                application for renewal of authorisation was pending and therefore, they were

                justified in continuing with their manufacturing process.

</p><p id="p_735">                               385.The question is whether the petitioner could have been

                permitted to handle and dispose of hazardous and other waste after the expiry

                of the authorization on 09.07.2013 without being monitored. The answer to

                this question should be a definite ‘No’. The petitioner would state that now

                they have filed a writ of Mandamus to renew the authorization. It is not clear

                as to why they did not resort to the same procedure in the year 2013, probably

                circumstances suited them. The petitioner may be partially right that adverse

                inferences cannot be drawn against them because they have been filed their

                returns and periodically addressing the authorities requesting them to renew

                the authorization. Unfortunately, the authorization is not a license in the

                normal sense. As pointed out earlier, the petitioner has no fundamental right

                to establish and operate a polluting industry. The very establishment is based

                on a consent granted by the TNPCB subject to condition. Even much prior to

                that, environmental clearance was required to be granted.           Therefore, the

                petitioner cannot state that as long as their application for renewal of

                authorization was pending, they can continue to handle and dispose of

                hazardous and other waste. In fact, stringent action has to be initiated against

                the officials of the TNPCB who were in-charge at the relevant point of time

                equally the superior officers and others at the helm of affairs of the Board. All

                of them were silent spectators to the illegality. We are not concerned about

                other industries which appear to be in a similar state. It is not clear as to why

                the State Government has abdicated its statutory responsibility cast under the

                Rules. The matter is a very serious issue and the petitioner cannot escape by

                contending that non-renewal of authorization can have no impact on the

                consent to operate.    The basic fallacy in such argument is because if an

                industry operates and produces the final product and in that process generates

                waste which are of various categories and so far as the petitioner is concerned,

                substantial waste generated are hazardous. Therefore, proper handling and

                disposal of the hazardous waste is paramount. Thus, if the authorization has

                not been granted for handling and disposal of the hazardous and other waste,

                then it goes without saying that consent to operate should cease.            Or else a

                polluting industry based upon the consent to operate will continue to operate,

                generate hazardous waste, handle and dispose of them without authorization

                under the HWM Rules which would mean that handling and disposal goes

                unmonitored. This position if allowed would be a death knell. The order

                passed by the TNPCB refusing to renew the consent to operate on the ground

                that the HW authorization was not in force is valid. It is true that the TNPCB

                did not take any action but that cannot be a license to the petitioner to pollute.

                Therefore, the said ground on which consent to operate was rejected is held

                valid and accordingly sustained.

                parameters of heavy metals such as arsenic in the ambient air through Board’s

                laboratory as was done for other parameters such as NOx, PM10 and SO2. It is

                further stated that as the Board’s laboratory does not have this facility, the

                petitioner should have engaged the services of MoEF and CC/NABL

                accredited laboratories and furnished report to the Board. The petitioner was

                informed that they have not complied with the same and as such there is no

                authenticated reporting on the presence of the arsenic in the ambient air. The

                other ground on which renewal was rejected was that during inspection on

                22.02.2018, the petitioner had been directed to construct a gypsum pond as per

                CPCB guidelines and they have not complied with the same till 31.03.2018.




</p><p id="p_738">                               387. First, let us take up the issue relating to ground water analysis.

                The argument on behalf of the petitioner is that for the first time in April 2018

                an allegation is made with regard to the ground water pollution and there was

                no such allegation earlier. It is submitted that there is no material to say that

                the ground water quality had worsened and there is no material to say that the

                petitioner is the cause for any ground water pollution. There are 67 other

                industries in the industrial complex and in spite of direction issued by the NGT

                no source apportionment study was done by the TNPCB and therefore to state

                that to be a reason for rejection of the renewal of consent to operate is not

                sustainable. The submission of the learned senior counsel was that this issue

                is being raised for the first time, it has become necessary to counter the

                allegations raised by the TNPCB in their counter affidavit because they are all

                new ground and in the first place, it should not be permitted to be canvassed.




</p><p id="p_739">                               388.According to the TNPCB, the order of consent mandates that

                the petitioner should obtain sample of emission and get them analysed by the

                TNPCB laboratory every month for the parameters indicated and furnish

                consent stated that the same will be revoked in case the ground water in the

                vicinity is affected due to seepage of effluent from storage sump. Further the

                renewal of consent is not just contingent on furnishing of ground water reports

                but also ensuring that there is full compliance with ground water norms and no

                pollution has occurred.      The respondent stated that the petitioner has not

                produced data to substantiate the fact nor made any averment that it has not

                caused ground water pollution.

                they have caused ground water pollution. The argument of the learned senior

                governance and superintendence – namely of constant self monitoring by the

                independently commissioned the collection of samples and testing at the cost

                of the petitioner. However, this is in addition to and not substitute of the

                consent condition. The TNPCB further submits that the reports show that

                water quality in and around the petitioner’s Unit has demonstrably worsened

                over time with TDS and heavy metal having increased manifold since 1996

                and have reduced after the petitioner has remained shut down for over an year.

                dead stock of gypsum and generally about 1 lakh tonnes per month of gypsum

                is generated and only some quantity is disposed. The gypsum is stored in the

                ponds in heaps to height of 15 to 20 feet and because of the excess height over

                the side walls they overflow and leachate due to storm water which may flow

                to adjacent areas and whenever wide spread rain occurs, the leachate may

                reach the surrounding areas and cause ground water pollution. It is further

                stated that though the petitioner claims to be a zero liquid discharge unit, the

                ground water contamination from the industry is due to heavy volume of

                gypsum, copper slag dumped in the open and from the secured land fill where

                the hazardous waste are disposed. The ground water samples collected from

                the monitoring wells around the gypsum pond indicate the increasing trend of

                ground water becoming highly toxic. The report of analysis of the monitoring

                well located around the gypsum pond during 2015-2018 conclusively

                demonstrate that the desirable/permissible limits were breached continuously.

                of which four have been capped and the fifth is under operation. It would be

                relevant to note that a quantity of 7,17,032 DMT (Dry Metric Ton) of

                hazardous waste is lying dumped in the SLF. The analysis of water samples

                collected from monitoring wells located around SLF from 2015 to 2018 shows

                the value exceeds at most instances. The report of analysis of water samples

                collected from the monitoring wells around the slag yard from 2015 to 2018

                shows that the parameters have exceeded multiple times. The leachate from

                copper slag open storage also contribute the increase in fluoride level and TDS

                in the ground water in surrounding villages. The above is the stand taken by

                the TNPCB. The petitioner’s response is on the following lines. Firstly, this

                was never a ground raised earlier and for the first time, such allegation is

                made. Secondly, the petitioner cannot be held responsible as it is a ZLD Unit.

                Assuming the ground water standards have fallen, the petitioner cannot be

                penalized because no source apportionment study was made though there was

                various reports and information secured under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_640">Information Act</a> to

                contend that the samples are within the permissible limits.

                Court in the year 2013 the same levels were shown, however, the petitioner

                was permitted to reopen. In our considered view that can hardly be a test to

                examine the correctness of the stand taken with regard to the ground water

                sample. Fall in ground water standards is a slow process especially when it is

                stated to have been caused on account of leaching. Therefore, due credence

                should be given to the report of analysis of water samples drawn from the

                monitoring wells. The petitioner cannot and should not cast a shadow of

                suspicion on all tests being undertaken by the Board. As pointed out earlier,

                the onus is on the petitioner to show that they have not contributed to the

                ground water deterioration for which they will have to substantiate with the

                steps taken by them and they cannot state that they have been called upon to

                prove the negative. This is so because the petitioner had no right to establish a

                polluting industry, but for the order of consent granted with conditions, the

                petitioner could not have establish the industry.          Therefore, it is for the

                petitioner to establish that they have not contributed to the fall in ground water

                standards in the villages surrounding the petitioner Unit.

                analysis in 1994 reported high fluoride content, i.e. 1.4 to      7 mg/l; gypsum is

                insoluble in water, hence calcium and sulphate increase is attributed to sea

                water intrusion and due to land extent of salt pans, TCS base line fluoride in

                for salt manufacturing.      Therefore, the petitioner would contend that the

                reasons given by TNPCB for rejecting the renewal of consent is untenable.

                demonstrate the analysis reports prepared by TNPCB in various areas in and

                around the petitioner's Unit and submitted that the petitioner is not the reason

                for increase in the TDS levels. The TDS level in the State of Tamil Nadu were

                reasons as to why the report is to be scrapped. Therefore the petitioner cannot

                rely upon the said report. The learned senior counsel referred to the report

                prepared by the Chennai testing laboratory on the ground water quality at

                Thoothukudi to demonstrate that leaching of secondary salts and

                anthropogenic impact fertilizer used for agricultural activities apart from sea

                water intrusion.       In response to the document produced by TNPCB, the

                petitioner referred to the sea water composition in which calcium sulphate is

                12600 ppm and the TDS is 350000 ppm and since there are as many as seven

                salts in the sea water, it accounts for total dissolve solids of sea water and

                nearby ground water resources.         Further, reference was made to the

                background document for development of WHO guidelines for drinking water

                and it was explained that TDS is the term used to describe the inorganic salts

                and small amounts of organic matter present in solution in water.                 The

                principal constituents are usually are calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium

                referring to various details of the phase equilibrium studies, it is stated that

                solubility of sodium chloride [salt] is higher when compared to that of

                gypsum. The sea water TDS contains large amount of soluble calcium and

                sulphate as compared to soluble calcium and sulphate present in

                phospogypsum generated from the petitioner's Unit. Therefore, the petitioner

                would state that the high TDS levels are not attributable to them but to the sea

                water intrusion. The petitioner blames TNPCB in attempting to selectively

                submit the data, thus preventing this Court from making a value decision.

                After referring to the ground water analysis report of the TNPCB, it is

                submitted that all the levels are below detectable limit and in particular,

                arsenic has not been detected at any of the Village bore wells in upstream or in

                the piezometric well location and downstream villages for over 22 years. With

                regard to the petitioner's marker pollutant fluoride, it is submitted that as per

                NGRI report, the entire region is likely to show that higher levels of chloride,

                sulphate and TDS and the fluoride presence is a direct linkage and the same is

                seen in the present case irrespective of that upstream villages or downstream

                villages when compared to piezometers of sterlite copper. With regard to the

                marker pollutant zinc, it is submitted that all samples taken are well below the

                prescribed standards. The higher TDS level is attributable to the intrusion of

                sea water. With regard to the chloride, once again the petitioner refers to

                NGRI report which states that the entire region is likely to show higher level,

                as also in the case of sulphate and total hardness. Thus, it is the submission of

                the petitioner that the TNPCB is deliberately making attempts to forego

                compliance, which were accepted by their Joint Chief Environmental Engineer

                through inspection. The respondent TNPCB suppresses the material before us

                to show that the quantity of ground water collected from eight locations in and

                around the petitioner, namely, Meelavittan, Silverpuram, Pandarampatti,

                Madathur [entrance], Madathur [opposite temple], South Veerapandiyapuram

                Kayaloorani and A.Kumarareddiarpuram shows very high values of TDS,

                after the closure up to February 2019. The data collected has been furnished

                in a tabulated form and it has been compared with the water quality data

                before the order of closure from which, it is seen that the TDS is gradually

                getting reduced almost in all Villages but still it does not satisfy the drinking

                water standards. Chloride is gradually getting reduced in Meelavittan and

                Silverpuram Village but still it does not satisfy the drinking water standards.

                Similarly, sulphate and total hardness are also getting gradually reduced but

                yet to meet the drinking water standards. By way of illustration, we refer to

                the chart showing the comparison of year wise maximum value of parameters

                with base line data during 1994 and the NEERI report of 2011. The standard

                and 5740 in February 2019. The petitioner wants us to discredit this data

                which we declined to do. The facts and figures placed before us has shown

                that there has been substantial increase in TDS levels and other chemical

                levels and the finger points to the petitioner and we are convinced to say so

                based on the data and the attempt of the petitioner to pick holes in the reports

                of the TNPCB cannot be accepted. The petitioner needs to be reminded that

                they operate based on consent granted by the TNPCB and they shall stand or

                fall by the assessment of TNPCB. To our surprise, the petitioner did not

                contest any of these issues earlier when matters cropped up and probably the

                petitioner was able to manage things.      We have also perused the graphs

                1998, 1999, 2005 and 2011. The report is a clear indicator to show that there

                has been steady and steep increase in TDS, chloride, sulphate and total

                hardness and there is a decline in the levels after closure of the petitioner. The

                petitioner's contention is that no arsenic has been detected from the

                piezometric wells and certain data was referred to support such submission.

                Schedule II of the HW Rules prescribes the concentration limit of arsenic at

                50 mg/kg. The soil samples were collected in five places during October 2018

                and has been analysed by M/s.SGS Limited, an NABL accredited lab, and we

                find that the arsenic level has exceeded the permissible limit in all the five

                places and the highest being near the copper slag in the patta land opposite to

                BPCL Petrol Bunk where the arsenic level is 771.4 mg/kg as compared to the

                prescribed limit of 50mg/kg. Further the report states that the slag samples

                collected in twelve locations contain arsenic in the range of 135 mg/kg to

                mg/kg. With regard to the gypsum, the report states that though the industry

                has provided ZLD, it had stored heaps of gypsum in the gypsum pond in an

                area about 40 acres and about 4 lakh tonnes of gypsum is stored in the gypsum

                pond and generally about 1 lakh tonne of gypsum is generated every month

                and it is stored in the pond above ground with a height of 15 to 20 feet and the

                heaps are above the side walls and due to excess height over the side wall, the

                leachate due to storm water may flow to the adjacent areas. The leachate

                water has been analysed to have high PH in the range of 2, which is acidic in

                nature.        The ground water has been analysed and reported that all the

                parameters analysed in the ground water around the gypsum pond exceed the

                drinking water standards and the increase has been due to the leachate from

                the area reaching the ground. The TNPCB has furnished colour photographs

                of the gypsum pond and one gets an impression as if it is an area which has

                had heavy snow fall but it was explained to us that it is not snow but it is

                because it is based on total constituent analysis and not TCLP extract. We

                cannot permit the petitioner to raise such a stand because the credibility of the

                agency which did the study cannot be easily disputed because it is an

                accredited laboratory. The fact remains that there is sufficient material to

                it is deemed that the petitioner has satisfied such condition.

                imposing conditions while granting orders of consent to establish or consent to

                operate.         The conditions continue to exist and are to be considered

                cumulatively, as but for the order of consent, the petitioner could not have

                established the industry. If at the inception, conditions had been imposed to

                enable the petitioner to operate, it goes without saying that till the petitioner is

                permitted to operate by renewal of consent subsequently, the conditions,

                which were imposed at first instance, must continue to hold the field and

                require scrupulous compliance. Therefore, to state that each order of renewal

                of consent is in effect, a separate order by itself without reference to the earlier

                order, is a wrong understanding of the scope of an order of consent.

                conditions imposed for establishment or for operation would become

                meaningless.           This is precisely the reason as to why the application for

                renewal of consent was rejected, viz., on the ground that five conditions

                imposed earlier were not complied with.            The condition imposed on the

                petitioner while granting consent to establish and subsequently consent to

                operate is a “permanent baggage” which the petitioner has to carry right

                through the journey of its existence. At any point of time, the Board is entitled

                to examine as to full and effective compliance of all those conditions. At this

                Court or Tribunal can modify or relax the rigour of any such condition

                imposed in the order of consent. The petitioner cannot challenge conditions

                imposed in the consent orders and all conditions are non-negotiable.

                about 5 kms away from the plant and the Board concluded that the AAQ

                thresholds were definitely breeched. The chronic health concerns due to SO 2

                exposures were also taken note of, people with asthma would experience

                greater breathing difficulty and the healthy adults will also experience

                counter affidavit that on 84 other occasions between October, 2012 till the

                closure in 2013, the emission exceeded the prescribed standards and this can

                hardly be due to calibration exercise. The petitioner challenged the said order

                before the NGT and an order of stay was granted and subsequently, the appeal

                was allowed setting aside the order of closure, which order of the NGT has

                been set aside by the Hon’ble Supreme Court with direction to file writ

                petitions before this Court. On account of the order of stay granted by NGT,

                the respondent Board could not shut down the petitioner’s plant.

                the order of the Board directing shut down of the plant. Order of stay by the

                Tribunal cannot be equated to a consent to operate. This, in the opinion of this

                Court, is so because the petitioner is a polluting industry and without an order

                of consent, they could have neither established, nor operated the unit.

                Therefore, even though the Tribunal had granted an order of stay of the

                shutdown, it goes without saying that unless and until the petitioner satisfies

                the parameters and obtains consent to operate, they cannot commence

                production. In other words, an order of stay by the Tribunal cannot be a

                substitute to an order of consent issued by the regulator. Unfortunately, the

                respondent Board missed this vital point and probably due to fear of being

                dragged to other judicial forum, they remained a silent spectator. This conduct

                of the respondent Board is nothing new, as we have seen earlier that though

                the HW authorisation had expired and had not been renewed, the respondent

                took no action to direct the petitioner to cease operations.                Thus, the

                respondent Board clearly misunderstood the scope of the order of stay granted

                by the Tribunal.

                on the assurance that all issues were being addressed. To say the least, it is an

                statement would be sufficient to draw adverse inference against the respondent

                Board. It is not clear as to what assurance was given by the petitioner and we

                find no justification for the Principal Secretary to now state in the counter

                prevail right up to closure. These facts would be sufficient to take disciplinary

                imposed in the earlier consent order and special conditions which were

                compliance of this condition is fatal to the petitioner. We say so because, the

                opinion of CPCB/TNPCB that slag is non-hazardous, non-leachable can be

                safely used for varied purposes are all based on data which is collected on an

                idealistic situation. Neither the CPCB, nor TNPCB can take a stand before us

                that 3.52 lakh metric tonnes of slag heaped in a place left to the fury of nature

                for several years can have no impact on the environment. Technical report

                says that dumping in abundance is hazardous. Therefore, the petitioner cannot

                wriggle out by stating that TNPCB and CPCB had approved the usage of slag

                for varied purposes and therefore, it has to be treated as non-hazardous.

                data, which has been filed as an annexure to the counter affidavit of the Board

                shows that even after closure, the TDS level does not satisfy drinking water

                be adopted. Such a plea cannot be raised by the petitioner, as even in the rapid

                EIA, those were the standards which were adopted and therefore, the petitioner

                is estopped from raising such a contention. In any event, when water samples

                are drawn from borewells and public wells, obviously the standard which has

                to be fulfilled is drinking water standards and not any other standard.

                Interestingly, the reports submitted by NEERI show that the petitioner had not

                complied with the conditions imposed in the orders of consent. NEERI had

                submitted reports in 1998, 1999, 2005, 2011, 2013 and 2018. In 2005, there is

                a report of the Supreme Court appointed Monitoring Committee on hazardous

                waste and in 2012, there is a joint inspection report of TNPCB and CPCB

                pursuant to directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Each of these reports, if

                carefully seen, would clearly show that there has been non-compliance of

                conditions. In fact, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the 2013 judgment, took

                note of the report of NEERI of 2005, recorded that the petitioner has caused

                pollution and the report did show that the emission and effluent discharge

                affected the environment. However, the Hon’ble Supreme Court pointed out

                that the report does not warrant a conclusion that the petitioner could not

                possibly take remedial steps. Therefore, the petitioner never stood exonerated

                by the Hon’ble Supreme Court as mentioned earlier, gave liberty to the Board

                to issue directions to the petitioner including direction for closure of the plant.

                Court in the various other paragraphs, where there is a categorical finding of

                pollution affecting the environment. The Monitoring Committee appointed by

                Hon’ble Supreme Court to inspect all units in the country generating

                hazardous wastes reported that there is a mountain of arsenic bearing slag as

                also phosphogypsum. Phosphogypsum if not contained properly, occasionally

                becomes airborne and may cause severe respiratory disease. The Committee

                was concerned with the issue relating to the disposal of arsenic containing

                slag, which was found dumped in the factory premises in the range of several

                thousands of tonnes. Further, the Committee also found that the petitioner

                industry is emitting SO2 far in excess of the permissible standard. The existing

                waste management practices of the petitioner are not in compliance with the

                of the petitioner, which was conducted by NEERI on the directions of

                TNPCB. This report also shows that the ground water samples did not meet

                the drinking water standards. The report of NEERI of 2011 also notes fugitive

                emission on account of raw material storage and handling of gypsum.

                with that portion of the reports which were found to be favourable to the

                inaction on the part of the TNPCB to act in the manner they were required to

                act. Thus, the Court would be well justified in assessing the conduct of the

                the petitioner was not fully compliant. If such be the factual position, the

                TNPCB or the State cannot be found fault for taking a precautionary decision.

                In fact, the decision, in our understanding is not precautionary, but a decision

                taken belatedly after the damage was done and it is rather doubtful as to

                whether the damage caused to the environment by the petitioner’s continued

                operation violating the conditions of consent is remediable. The compensation

                industrial parlance, the petitioner as well as the regulator may assess the

                process of de-bottle necking to be a scientific process by which, the

                equipments are put to optimum use and production is increased. However, as

                a Court examining an environmental matter, is not fully convinced as to why

                there is no requirement for an environmental clearance before grant of

                permission to increase the production capacity for a hazardous and inherently

                dangerous industry. This is so because by increase of production, there is

                undoubtedly going to be increase in the generation of hazardous and other

                wastes, which has an impact on environment. Therefore, it is high time, the

                MoEF initiate a thought process on these lines because, the correct test would

                be what is the ultimate quantity of material produced by the industry.

                Interestingly, on 09.08.2007, ex post facto clearance was granted under the

                EIA notification, 2006 by ratifying the EC obtained for de-bottlenecking.

                Diluting the requirement of prior EC would be a death knell.

                have to be noted.          The report states that it is a report on short term

                investigation of ground water quality in and around S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_660">IPC</a>OT industrial area.

                In the executive summary of the report, it has been stated that in accordance

                with the direction of the Regional Director of South Eastern Coastal Region,

                Chennai, a hydro-chemical study was carried out to assess ground water

                quality in and around S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_661">IPC</a>OT industrial area, Thoothukudi, wherein the

                petitioner is one of the industries.

                Director, SECR, Chennai, to direct for a hydro-chemical study to be conducted

                in an industrial complex and areas adjoining to it without the express written

                consent of the concerned authorities. Secondly, the timing of the report in

                July, 2018 is very crucial because by then, the petitioner had been closed

                down. In paragraph 2.2 of the report, it is stated that the investigation team

                could not enter into the premises of the petitioner for collection of samples

                from inside and outside of the industry because District Authorities have

                sealed the petitioner’s plant following Government orders to close down the

                plant permanently.        Thus, the inspecting team and the Regional Director,

                SECR was fully aware of the Government order which was in vogue, sealing

                and permanently closing down the plant. In such situation, we find that the

                intention of the Regional Director to have directed a study to be conducted

                appears to be with certain ulterior motive. However, since the said authority is

                not a party to the litigation, the Court would not be justified in making any

                observations adverse to a person, who is not heard.

                closure, it did not augur well on the part of a Central Government

                notifying the TNPCB or the District Administration. The study undertaken

                was not a general study, but with specific reference to the petitioner. This is

                clear from reading the executive summary of the report. Considering all these

                facts, we are of the definite view that the said report of July, 2018 submitted

                by two scientists directed to investigate ground water quality by the Regional

                Director, SECR of Central Ground Water Board deserves to be scrapped and

                Government had issued a press release on 08.09.2018, stating that the

                direction to conduct an assessment of the quality of ground water in the area

                lacked bona fide and it is inappropriate at the given time. After referring to

                the fact that the investigating team could not enter into the factory premises

                unwarranted conclusion, absolutely vague and not supported by empirical

                data. Further, the report does not appear to be made on any scientific basis

                and it is not known as to how the two scientists who had submitted the report

                have made such a vague and unsubstantiated statement in the report.

                Therefore, it was stated that the State of Tamil Nadu strongly feels that the

                report is motivated and has been prepared only to prejudice the Government of

                Tamil Nadu and TNPCB, as cases are pending in various judicial forum.

                directed joint inspection by NEERI, CPCB and TNPCB. This report was

                submitted before the Hon’ble Supreme Court and the TNPCB was directed to

                imposed in the earlier consent order. Thus, the aspects of environmental

                pollution which were subject matter of consideration after the report of NEERI

                of 2005 cannot be put in a water tight compartment.            There are various

                activities done by the petitioner in its manufacturing process and different

                kinds of wastes are generated and it is not a simple operation whereby, the

                conditions can be very specific. This is more so because, the petitioner deals

                with hazardous substances and it is a chemical industry and each activity has a

                reaction. Therefore, it would be incorrect on the part of the petitioner to

                contend that 30 conditions were imposed by the TNPCB and all thirty has

                been complied with and the Hon’ble Supreme Court was satisfied and

                everything has been done and dusted. This contention of the petitioner is a

                there has been environmental degradation on account of the petitioner’s

                operations. One more aspect, which we had noted was that the Hon’ble

                Supreme Court interfered with the judgment of the Division Bench of this

                Court primarily for the reason that the Court exceeded its jurisdiction while

                exercising power of judicial review.       After rendering such a finding, the

                Hon’ble Supreme Court found that the petitioner had caused extensive

                environmental pollution, however, thought fit to grant one more opportunity to

                the petitioner because in the assessment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the

                situation was a remediable, that apart, owing to efflux of time between 2005

                and 2011. The Hon’ble Supreme Court directed a joint inspection to be done

                with and only one more direction has to be complied with which was also

                removed when the judgment was pronounced.           Accordingly, the order of

                closure passed by the Division Bench was set aside. Yet the Hon’ble Supreme

                Court held that the judgment will not stand in the way of the TNPCB issuing

                directions to the petitioner including direction for closure of the plant. This

                observation would not have been necessary, if the Hon’ble Supreme Court had

                been satisfied that “all is well” with the petitioner.       It did not find the

                explanation of the petitioner to be satisfactory. Fine of Rs.100 Crores was

                imposed and payment of the said fine to not to be considered as exonerating

                the petitioner of the damage done. This is clear from the observations made

                by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in paragraph 50 of the judgment giving liberty

                to TNPCB to close down the industry. Therefore, selective reading of the

                Court needs to confine itself to see as to whether the five conditions which are

                stated to have not been complied with are true and if one or more is true

                whether, it should ultimately result in an order of closure/permanent closure.

                In other words, it was contended that if an order of consent contains thirty

                conditions, and while renewing the said order, another set of twenty conditions

                are imposed, it is deemed that the petitioner has complied with all the thirty

                that the area of plantation within the industry is estimated as 13.1 Ha as

                against the total area of 102.5 Ha. However, based on plantation assessment,

                only 10.8% including the area under-development. Further, the report states

                that in some places, the area of the green belt is less than 25m and more than

                10m and in some areas, it is less than 10m . Further, in the periphery near the

                for expansion of 900 TPD to 1200 TPD, has also been complied with.

                Ultimately, the petitioner would contend that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its

                final judgment dated 02.04.2013 has held that the green belt of the petitioner

                would have been imposed. The fact remains till 2011, the petitioner did not

                have adequate green belt area and they were deficient. When they were faced

                with orders of closure and they were operating on order of stay, on inspection

                being done, time appears to have been granted to develop green belt area.

                Therefore, from the materials, which have been placed before this Court, what

                is evident is, from 1995 to 2011, the petitioner did not comply with the

                condition fully and faithfully. When inspection was conducted, inadequacy

                was pointed out, which according to the petitioner has been complied with.

                that such dense green belt was required around the battery limit of the unit and

                the requirement will not be taken to have been complied, if green cover is

                established in selected spots and spaces in the premises of the petitioner. This

                is precisely so because, while granting consent to establish the condition was

                obliterate the requirement, nor it can be taken that the petitioner has deemed to

                argument is put forth. The entire issue as to whether the petitioner industry

                should be permitted to continue or not is writ large before this Court by way of

                writ petitions filing under two categories. One set of cases challenging the

                Government Order to close and permanently seal the petitioner. The other set

                of writ petitions is in effect appeals against the decision of the regulator.

                because the regulator, viz., the original authority did not mention, the same

                cannot be a ground to restrict the powers of appellate authority in looking into

                application filed against the Russian Federation filed by a Russian national

                alleging that the operation of a steel plant is in close proximity to her home

                endangered her health and well being. The background facts being, the steel

                plant was established about 300 kms North-East of Moscow. The applicant

                moved to a flat approximately 450m from the steel plant.               The flat was

                provided by the plant to the applicant's husband under tenancy agreement.

                The plant was the largest iron smelter in Russia and employed about 60,000

                people. In order to delimit the area in which the pollution caused by steel

                production might be excessive, the authorities established a buffer zone around

                the premises called the “sanitary security zone” (akin to green belt). This zone

                was first delimited in 1965, it covered a 5,000m wide area around the site of

                the plant. However, many people still lived within the plant's sanitary security

                zone. The applicant with her family and other residents of the flats brought a

                Court action seeking re-settlement outside the zone, they claimed that the

                concentration of toxic elements and the noise levels in the sanitary security

                zone exceeded the maximum permissible limits by Russian Legislation. The

                applicant contended that the emission levels of 13 hazardous substances, such

                as nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, sulphur dioxide, ammonia etc., were

                monitored by the authorities and the data collected by the State Monitoring

                Authorities were not publicly available.         The applicant claimed that the

                and continues to exceed the safe level established by the relevant legislation.

</p><p id="p_841">                               457.The Court while dealing with the sanitary security zone, noted

                that the legislature placed a mandatory duty for every polluting undertaking to

                create sanitary security zone around its premises – a buffer area separating

                sources of pollution from the residential area of the city. Under the sanitary

                regulation of the said country, the sanitary security zone around the steel plant

                of such magnitude was 2000m. It was pointed out that the existence of a

                sanitary security zone is a condition sine qua non for the operation of an

                environmentally hazardous undertaking otherwise, it must be closed down or

                significantly re-structured. It was further pointed out that the main purpose of

                the sanitary security zone is to separate residential areas from the sources of

                pollution and thus to minimise the negative effects thereof on the neighbouring

                population. It was further pointed out that it would only be possible for the

                steel plant to operate in conformity with the domestic environmental

                standards, if the sanitary security zone continued to exist and served its

                purpose.

                those registered near the applicant's home.          While considering the said

                argument, the Court pointed out that it proves that the steel plant has failed to

                comply with the domestic environmental norms and suggests that a wider

                sanitary security zone should perhaps have been required. The Court found

                that the State had authorised the operation of a polluting plant in the middle of

                a densely populated town. Since the toxic emission from the plant exceeded

                the safe limits established by the domestic legislation and might endanger the

                health of those living nearby, the State established through legislation that a

                pollution to acceptable level. Accordingly, it held that the respondent-State

                has failed to strike a fair balance between the interest of the community and

                the applicant's effective enjoyment of her right to respect for her home and her

                plant and therefore, in the opinion of TNPCB, there is no possible seepage into

                the ground or ambient area. The remaining 12 units include other food units,

                titanium factory and thermal power plant and the petitioner's four units are the

                only one which emit substantial amount of SO2. Further, it has been stated

                that there is no other industry which emits toxic gases at dangerous levels in

                the industrial complex and other industries such as refined edible oil plant, see

                food processing plant, cold storage units, ice plant industries do not emit SO2.

                The other polluting industry in the area is M/sVV Titanium private limited,

                which extracts titanium from limanite ore using sulphuric acid, it is stated by

                TNPCB that there is no emission of toxic gases from the said industry.

                Further, it is stated that other industries in the area are medium and small scale

                industries, where the emission of SO2 is extremely negligible.

                has not been discriminated, as they appear to be the biggest in the industrial

                complex not only because of the number of units they have and area occupied,

                volume of production, but more importantly, the quantity of emission either it

                be by way of discharge into the secured land fill or into the treatment plant or

                disposed to the recycler or let out into the air through the stacks. Therefore, if

                the TNPCB had genuinely acted in public interest, they would have rolled

                back the order reducing the green belt requirement to 25m and should have

                imposed a condition that the increased production capacity should be rolled

                back or the petitioner should have been directed to               cease operation till

                completion of the requirement. The green belt requirement ought to have been

                increased while considering the application for enhancement in production

                capacity.

                green belt with native species at least 10 meter thick green belt in the

                periphery of hazardous wastes facility, green belt shall cover 33% of the total

                area. After discussing about the various types of the native species, which

                should be grown, the paper concludes by stating that development of green

                belt consisting of three tier along the periphery of the project with native

                species is most important guideline for any type of industry. The green belt

                minimises the build-up of pollution level in urban/industrial area by acting as

                pollution sinks, it will absorb pollutants released from the industrial activity

                into the atmosphere and helps in effective pollution control.              The main

                advantages of green belt in and around the industry are to control air and noise

                pollution, trees help in trapping particulate mater, removing carbon dioxide

                and other pollutants from air and by releasing oxygen thereby, improving the

                air quality. Green belt reduces the intensity of sound by deflect, refract or by

                absorb sound and it will function as barrier between industry and waiver roof.

                countries.             However,   based   on   directions        issued      by      the

                may be true that the green belt, which was initially prescribed as 250m, was

                reduced by TNPCB to 25m. However, when the petitioner was permitted to

                expand and increase production by the process of de-bottlenecking, the green

                belt requirement was not increased. The petitioner's argument is that a fresh

                increase in pollution level. Therefore, it goes without saying that if there is an

                green belt, which is overlooked, is that the plants constituting green belts are

                living organisms, with limits to its tolerance towards air pollutants. As a

                result, crossing the threshold limits in terms of pollution load would lead to

                injury to plants causing death of tissues and reducing their absorption

                potentials. Sink efficiency of unhealthy and death tissue and lives is known to

                be extremely low, thus defeating the very purpose of green belt. It is stated

                that a green belt is effective as pollution sinks only within the tolerance limits

                of constituent plants.

                and more than 95% of the pollutant enters a plant through the route of gaseous

                exchange. Chemical reactions leading to leaf injury or absorption of sulphur

                from SO2 into the metabolic stream have been described. The adverse effect

                also refer to the other pollutants like nitres oxide, carbon dioxide, hydro

                carbons, other mixtures of pollutants, etc.       The guidelines also give a

                development model by way of a formula. The effectiveness of a green belt is

                also ascertained mathematically and the procedure is also given in the

                guidelines. Therefore, the importance of establishing a green belt, developing

                green cover is a continuous obligation on a polluter.

                cancellation of the examination conducted, where there were serious

                allegations of mass copying. Accordingly, it was held that the principle laid

                down in Mohinder Singh Gill is not applicable where larger public interest is

                involved and in such situation, additional grounds can be looked into to

                examine the validity of an order. To the said effect, also is the judgment in

                information/clarification, which was required during the course of preliminary

                examination of the proposal for expansion. It was mentioned that the total

                plant is located in 95.51 Ha as per the records available in the Ministry; the

                to submit actual figure, as there were discrepancies. While responding to the

                query, by reply dated 19.01.2007, the petitioner states that the total area of the

                project is 172.17 Ha in which, 95.51 Ha was existing land under Pre-LTPA

                clearly show that it is not a direct answer to the simple query. Once again the

                petitioner maintains that the total area of the project is 172.17 Ha without

                plainly disclosing that the extent of land held by them is only 102.31 Ha and

                they are not in possession of 172.17 Ha. At this juncture, we need to note that

                when the Committee appointed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court to examine and

                submit report in respect of all red category industries, the Committee clearly

                recommended that the petitioner's application for expansion may not be

                considered for the reason that the existing waste management practices of the

                petitioner are not in compliance with the environmental standards and the solid

                hazardous wastes generated also required to be properly managed, particularly

                in terms of available space and infrastructure, which would be inadvisable to

                consider expansion of the unit at that stage.         The MoEF while granting

                environmental clearance dated 22.09.2004, for the expanded capacity from

                300 TPD to 900 TPD, noted the total area of the project as 95.51 Ha, out of

                which 30.65 Ha was earmarked for the proposed expansion. On 09.09.2005,

                the petitioner submitted an application to TNPCB for grant of consent to

                establish the expanded production capacity for Smelter Plant No.I from 900

                TPD to 1200 TPD stating that the total extent of land required after the de-

                bottlenecking is 172.17 Ha.     Based on this application, TNPCB granted

                consent to establish. The petitioner filed an application on 02.01.2007 seeking

                post facto environmental clearance for the expanded capacity, that is, from 900

                TPD to 1200 TPD and while seeking for such clearance on 09.08.2007, the

                total project area is mentioned as 172.17 Ha and the green belt of 43 Ha to be

                developed from the total extent of 172.17 Ha. M/s.Vimta Labs prepared the

                rapid EIA for the expansion from 900 TPD to 1200 TPD wherein the extent of

                land is mentioned as 172.17 Ha. When the MoEF granted EC for Smelter

                Plant No.II on 01.01.2009, the extent of land acquired by the petitioner is

                stated as 92.5 Ha. In April-May, 2009, TNPCB inspected Smelter Plant No.I

                petitioner is mentioned as 172.17 Ha. The same extent also finds place in the

                monitoring report dated 12.07.2012 submitted to the MoEF. When TNPCB

                granted renewal of consent on 12.07.2012, the extent is mentioned as 172.17

                Ha while mentioning about the green belt. While on this issue, it is interesting

                to note that in the inspection report of the TNPCB of the inspection conducted

                on 11.11.2006, the land use classification has been mentioned as “general

                industrial”. Considering all these facts, we have no hesitation to hold that the

                petitioner had not disclosed the actual extent of land held by them.

                to be not a direct answer to the query raised by MoEF. The fact remains that

                the petitioner did not hold an extent of 172.17 Ha on the date when

                environmental clearance was granted, the order granting environmental

                clearance dated 09.08.2007 mentions total project area as 172.17 Ha, but for

                the petitioner furnishing this extent to the MoEF, the same would not have

                been mentioned in the order granting environmental clearance. Therefore, the

                petitioner failed to disclose the actual extent held by them while they applied

                for environmental clearance. Furthermore, their application for post facto

                clearance dated 02.01.2007 itself has to be held to be not maintainable,

                because the post facto clearance itself sought for is environmental clearance

                and there can be no such post facto decision being taken in environmental

                matters. In this regard, it would be beneficial to refer to the recent decision of

                the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Hanuman Laxman Aroskar.

</p><p id="p_881">                               482.The next question would be as to what would be the impact of

                the failure to disclose the actual extent of land held by the petitioner. In our

                considered view, this would have far reaching consequences because increased

                production would mean increased generation of waste, which obviously would

                require larger extent of land and this would have a chain reaction leading to

                various other issues some of which are beyond comprehension. Thus, when

                the petitioner did not have 172.17 Ha for Smelter Plant No.I, the question of

                granting environmental clearance for the proposed expansion would not arise.

                This failure to disclose the correct details has led to an order being passed by

                the MoEF granting environmental clearance on the ground that the petitioner

                possessed 172.17 Ha.          Thus, if the factual position is otherwise, the

                environmental clearance itself should be construed to be non-est.

                grounds mentioned therein , the petitioner would admit that this issue was

                state that it is the intervenor, who raised the point, and thereafter, the TNPCB

                took up the issue. This can hardly be a reason for this Court to refuse to test

                the correctness of the submission regarding inadequate stack height. This is so

                because, as a regulator, TNPCB is entitled to impose conditions. We have

                on the part of the petitioner, the source from which, the regulator got-

                inspiration to say so is irrelevant, as the factum whether there is inadequacy or

                downwind direction as well as where maximum ground level concentrations

                are anticipated specially, covering         human settlements for estimation of

                particulates, fluoride dust, SO2 etc., in consultation with the State Pollution

                Control Board; and there should be no change in the stack design without prior

                approval from the State Pollution Control Board and the Ministry (MoEF). If

                such is the condition imposed on the petitioner, the question would be

                whether, the petitioner could have calculated the stack height based on the

                formulae adopted for power plant stacks.

                efficiency or efficacy of the pollution control measures installed by the

                The petitioner contends that they had adopted an advanced technology even as

                early as in the year 2003 or 2012, when there was no such thought process by

                MoEF. Nevertheless, if a regulation has been put in place or an instruction or

                order has been given by the Ministry, it binds the industry. If according to the

                notification, the stack height has to be more than 80m, a single stack, the

                petitioner cannot state that they have provided two stacks of more than 60m

                Engineering, IIT, Madras, has given his opinion wherein, he states that the

                height of the stack emitting SO2 or acid mist shall be of minimum 30m or as

                per the formulae H=14(Q) , whichever is more, and by adopting this formulae

                and taking note of the total capacity of the petitioner with 2 kg/ton acid

                produced, the stack height would be 83.5m and if emission factor of 1 kg/ton

                was to be considered for stack height design, it would be 67.8m. The expert

                concludes by stating that the sulphuric acid plant's stack height of 60m is not

                in consonance with the CPCB Rules, nor it is adequate if the lower emission

                rates of 1 kg/ton is considered. Further, the stack height will be inadequate for

                effective dispersion of SO2 pollutants and it has to be verified, if this will

                attribute to excessive ground level concentration of SO2 in ambient air under

                furnace at 4 kg/ton acid produced would be 102.8m and height as per 1 kg/ton

                emission rate would be 67.8m. Thus, the finding is, the furnace stack height is

                only 60m as against 102.8m as per the CBCB norms and this will contribute to

                excessive ground level concentration of SO2 in ambient air. Thus, viewed

                from any angle, what is abundantly clear is that, there is non-compliance of the

                stack height norm stipulated by the CPCB.

                covered with thick tarpaulin or plastic sheets, so that when the garbage is

                transported from the Metropolitan City to the dump yard, there should be no

                the reply given by the petitioner, we find that they have rightly understood as

                to what to mean a “closed truck” and that is why they had proposed to

                purchase trucks with automatic top cover and also stated to have purchased a

                few trucks with such facility. The object of imposing a condition to transport

                the raw material by a closed truck is to avoid spillage en-route and the distance

                is 18 kms from the Thoothukudi Port. Therefore, spillage is bound to occur

                and when transported at reasonable speed, the fly-off cannot be obviously

                averted and a tarpaulin cover tied with streams of rope can hardly prevent

                spillage especially when, the wind speed is more and the situation will be

                aggravated, when the trucks are also driving in a speed of more than 60 kmph.

                The petitioner would state that the remnants are vacuum cleaned. We presume

                that this process is adopted in the port premises and not en-route. If the

                remnants are removed by vacuum cleaning en-route, it would go to show that

                the raw material has not been transported as directed by TNPCB. The Madras

                Port had been handling coal imported from various countries and the vessels

                are berthed at the Madras Port. The coal was transported in tipper trucks and

                we have found that the trucks are covered and the trucks were given exit out of

                the port premises through a gate opposite to the War Memorial. Invariably,

                the movement of trucks is permitted late in the evening up to dawn. As a

                result of movement of these trucks, the entire area would be covered with a

                thick cover of coal dust and it required heavy equipments to be used to remove

                the coal dust, as it had caused several accidents, not only it has caused

                pollution by way of spillage, but also has resulted in fatal accidents. That

                apart, the heritage building of the Madras High Court was also a victim to the

                indiscriminate handling of coal in the port premises. This has led to a Public

                Interest Litigation being filed before this Court and ultimately, the coal

                handling facility was shifted by the Madras Port Trust to a different location.

                Therefore, we can perceive and safely conclude that the petitioner did not take

                adequate precaution while transporting the copper concentrate from the port

                premises to their factory for a distance of about 18 kms.

                the quality of the copper concentrate, which had been imported by the

                petitioner stating that there is high arsenic content in the copper concentrate

                thereby, causing health hazard to port workers and susceptible to cancer. The

                respondents alleged that the petitioner is procuring low quality copper

                concentrate and that is why, it is called “Fools Gold”. Further, it is contended

                that the copper concentrate imported by the petitioner contains various

                elements including hazardous material and annually, the petitioner imports 11

                lack tons of copper concentrate containing 25-100 PPM arsenic.

                inception to eliminate emission to the surrounding environment and the

                technology is used by several developed countries. It is further submitted that

                the petitioner in their application to MoEF for clearance of their increased

                production capacity from 900 TPD to 1200 TPD, mentioned the estimated

                range of arsenic value in copper concentrate in market during that period. The

                quality of the copper concentrate varies due to natural phenomenal occurring

                in mines and the respondent's calculation is based on wrong assumption

                without considering the nature of copper imported by the petitioner.

                prepared by Tata Consultancy Services at the request of the petitioner. In

                Chapter V of the said report, which deals with “Environmental Management

                Plan”, it is stated that the petitioner is planning to procure copper concentrates

                nearly arsenic free with a result that separate treatment of arsenic wastes may

                not be required, however, provision for treatment of arsenic wastes should be

                quality of the copper concentrate procured by the petitioner primarily because

                TNPCB has not shown to have done any analysis or monitoring with regard to

                the efficacy or otherwise of the raw material procured by the petitioner. In

                fact, if the TNPCB had taken up an exercise of verifying the quality of the raw

                material imported by the petitioner, much of the allegations which have

                cropped up now, would not have arisen. The material placed before us does

                not sufficiently put forth as to what was the analysis done, when the cargo was

                off-loaded the vessel at the port premises. Even assuming if samples were

                drawn, the question is as to whether TNPCB had regularly monitored the raw

                material imported by the petitioner especially, when they had in their rapid

                EIA report, accepted to procure arsenic free copper concentrate. Therefore,

                much has to be said about the lack of proper monitoring on the part of the

                regulator and ensuring that checks and balances are put in place.                   As

                mentioned by us earlier, the TNPCB is under-equipped to deal with industries,

                which are of the magnitude of the petitioner, which carries on multiple

                processes, and several by-products and wastes are generated in the processes

                which may require monitoring at different stages, at different locations and at

                different times. We have also mentioned in our assessment that the data

                collected from the petitioner are through the monitors established by the

                TNPCB, which are not analysed. Had such an exercise been done, periodical

                notices would have been issued to the petitioner not only when an incident

                occurs or is reported. Therefore, the regulator needs to take the blame for not

                having adequately monitored this aspect of the matter. The projection, which

                was made by way of the rapid EIA report in the year 1995, is to procure

                copper concentrate nearly arsenic free and this will result in not requiring a

                separate treatment of arsenic waste.     The petitioner obviously could not

                achieve it and that is precisely the reason that the arsenic is fixed in the ETP

                sludge, which is disposed of in the on-sight secured land fill. Therefore, the

                quality of the copper concentrate is definitely an issue, which is a matter of

                concern and we shift the blame to the TNPCB.

                to visit and inspect the petitioner's unit and determine environmental

                compliance and impact. The committee found, the petitioner was not strictly

                complying with the provisions of the Act, Rules and consent conditions and

                made their recommendation for compliances and, this assumes significance, as

                in spite of imposition of consent conditions and regular interventions by the

                TNPCB, the petitioner has been continuously non-complaint. The 1998 report

                of NEERI states that the industry should not have been located at the present

                place; public participation ought to have been held; there is no perceptible

                green belt in the industry; relaxation of green belt condition is without

                construct new infrastructure that had not been done previously, was placed on

                reopen and the TNPCB granted consents to operate. The Monitoring

                Committee appointed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the petitioner's

                application for proposed expansion should not be granted. The report of

                has only attempted compliance under threat of judicial orders of

                closure/intervention and cannot be allowed to run a highly polluting red

                category industry, when the petitioner is oblivious to ecological sensitivities

                the petitioner cannot be heard to say that it is a one time condition and any

                such attempt made by the petitioner is liable to be out rightly rejected because,

                green belt is a natural phenomenal, which involves a process of maintaining a

                operate. They were operating either on account of orders passed by

                Courts/Tribunal, or by stating that application for renewal of consent was

                pending. The first renewal of consent was valid up to 31.03.1998 and it was

                renewed only on 20.05.1999.       In the interregnum period, the matter was

                pending before the Court and the petitioner still continued to operate

                contending that they have submitted application for renewal of consent and

                also remitted the requisite fee. The consent, which was renewed on

                20.05.1999, was valid only up to 31.03.2000. The petitioner had operated the

                plant without an order of consent from 01.04.2000 to 18.04.2005, as an interim

                order was granted in the year 1999 and the petitioner states that their

                application for renewal of consent was submitted and requisite fee was paid.

                Thus, the petitioner has operated for 16 years and 92 days without consent

                from the TNPCB, it has operated for 10 years, 2 months and 15 days without a

                HWM authorisation. As mentioned earlier, even if a Court or Tribunal has

                granted an order of stay of closure, the natural corollary that should follow is

                granted by a Court or Tribunal can at best protect closure on a permanent

                basis, but the industry being, a highly polluting industry could not have been

                established or continued its activities without an order of consent, an order of

                stay or injunction by a Court or Tribunal, cannot be a substitute to an order of

                consent to operate granted by a regulator.

                passed by the NGT and during the said period, they did not have a valid

                consent to operate, and ultimately, the application for renewal of consent for

                five years from September, 2018 was rejected by the impugned order. Thus, it

                is evidently clear that there was no proper         monitoring of the industry

                presumably on account of the orders of Court/Tribunal, TNPCB did nothing in

                the matter, though it was well open to the regulator to inspect and ascertain as

                to whether the petitioner can be permitted to continue to operate the unit. The

                regulator failed to discharge their duties diligently bearing in mind the purpose

                for which it was constituted, nothing prevented the regulator from approaching

                the Court by way of an appropriate application appraising the facts and the

                allows to track materials, for example, pollutants from one place to another

                with mass balance equations and this is stated to be the most widely used tools

                in analysing pollutants in the environment. It is further stated that the first step

                in a mass balance analysis is to define the particular region in space that is to

                be analysed which is often called the control volume.               By picturing an

                imaginary boundary around the region, one can begin to quantify the flow of

                materials across the boundary as well as accumulation and reaction of

                materials within the region. It is further stated that a substance that enters the

                control volume has four possible fates, namely, it may leave the region

                unchanged, some of it accumulate within the boundary and some of it may be

                converted to some other substance.         There is also possibility that more

                substance may be produced. By way of illustration, it is stated that CO may be

                produced by cigarette smoking within the control volume of a room. Further it

                0.28-0.30 MT per ton of copper concentrate.            The design production as

                mentioned by the petitioner for 20.17-2018 is 0.35 and as per the annual report

                it is 0.2871. Therefore, the 9 respondent would state that the averments made

                by the petitioner in the counter affidavit are false statements. If according to

                the petitioner what has been stated in the counter is correct, then the petitioner

                is guilty of falsifying production figures to its shareholders in the United

                Kingdom and also to the Central Government/GST authorities in India. If on

                petitioner is guilty of perjury for having provided false and misleading

                information to the Court by way of an affidavit. It is further contended that

                the spent anode should not be mentioned as input as it is a product from the

                process that is recycled back into the smelter. However, there is no such

                mention of spent anode in the input side in any other document.                     It is

                submitted that the reason for doing so is to artificially increase the quantum of

                anode so as to budget/allocate more quantum of arsenic than what is actually

                present. It is further stated that the spent anode according to the table is

                64467MT, calculating the production of the petitioner for 52 weeks in a year it

                is stated that the total anode per year is 22848 multiplied by 50 would be 1142

                MT of spend anodes. Therefore, the figure of 64467 tones of spend anode as

                mentioned in the table is false and to generate such quantity it will take 56

                years and cannot be done in a single year, namely, 2017-18. Therefore, it is

                submitted that for computing mass balance arsenic in copper concentrate is

                relevant on the input side and the petitioner has resorted to this inflation to

                Thus, it is the contention of the 9 respondent that in 2017-2018, 721.59 MT

                of arsenic is unaccounted and this quantum of arsenic has been released into

                the environment and the claim of the petitioner that they have operated within

                the four corners of law is false apart from the fact that the petitioner operated

                without authorization under HWM Rules and without manifest as specified in

                Rule 19 of the HWM Rules, it will not be possible to locate the hazardous

                waste generated and disposed of by the petitioner.           The response of the

                petitioner is that their copper smelter is based on pyrometallurgical extraction

                process. Elements other than copper are very minor in the input in the copper

                concentrate and are usually in the order of PPM. Non-copper metals from

                smelter are recovered either by Gas Cleaning Plant [GCP] or in the refinery. It

                is submitted that all metals are either recovered and sold to authorized

                petitioner has referred to the details of metal extraction as found in Volume 12

                It is submitted that the total gross copper anode for FY 2017-18 is 392544

                MT; fresh copper anode produced from copper concentrate is 328076 MT as

                reported in the annual report; the imported copper anode for cold doping in the

                FY 2017-18 is 64464 MT. Therefore, the total gross anode is 392544 MT and

                this total gross anode considered for this mass balance is sum of fresh copper

                analysis produced by the petitioner for all input and output material with

                regard to the copper production except spent anode and this is because of

                misleading of the table wherein the nomenclature of the spent anode has been

                used for the copper anode which is an external input to the copper operations.

                Further, it is stated that in the 2005 report of NEERI, the copper refinery

                refinery operation started only in the year 2005. Further it is stated that in-

                house produced scrap anode are not considered for calculating mass balance as

                they have already been considered in the first input. It is submitted that 64467

                mentioned the estimated range of arsenic value in the copper concentrate

                ranges which have been mentioned by the petitioner while filing its application

                to the MoEF. The learned senior counsel for the petitioner has also drawn the

                attention of the Court to the overview of the copper concentrate quality and

                of arsenic which is generated in the process is not what has been mentioned by

                the petitioner while submitting application before the MoEF. Therefore, what

                stems out of this submission is that the arsenic which is generated during the

                process continues to vary. The NEERI in its report of March 2005 states that

                the petitioner is using copper concentrate which are sourced from various

                countries and at the time of visit to the industry, the petitioner was using three

                types of copper concentrate having arsenic content of 156 MG/KG, 350

                MG/KG and 628 MG/KG with corresponding copper levels of 39.8%, 46.4%

                and 35.3%. The report further states that copper concentrate with less arsenic

                content, i.e. 156 MG/KG are available and it has recommended that the

                petitioner use such cleaner concentrate which will reduce the level of arsenic

                in the down stream waste and waste waters. With regard to the arsenic

                balance, it is stated that 0.008 MT/day of arsenic remains unaccounted which

                may be attributed to the untapped fugitive emission and the concentration of

                critical to monitor in the treated effluent which is used by the petitioner to

                achieve zero discharge and the TNPCB is required to stipulate a level of

                arsenic in the treated effluent to avoid arsenic accumulation in slags, etc. In

                Table 6.8 in the report, the unaccounted quantity of arsenic has been furnished

                in a tabular column showing the stream from which it is generated. The

                petitioner filed an application to the MoEF on 03.01.2007 for ratification of

                900 MTPD to 1200 MTPD copper production by de-bottlenecking project and

                in annexure 4 to the said application, the petitioner has mentioned that in

                anodes, it is in the range of 200-300 TPM. In the rapid EIA done by Vimta

                waste manifest in Form No.13 dated 02.06.2015, wherein the waste

                description has been given. The report submitted by NEERI of May 2011 to

                the Hon'ble Supreme Court gives the raw material composition and production

                details of the petitioner from 2004-2005 to April 2011 and the source of

                information is based on CPCB inspection conducted during January 2011.

                The relevant portion of the annual reports of the petitioner has also been filed.

                From all the above facts and details placed on either side, what emerges is that

                there is substantial quantity of arsenic, which comes out of the process and

                admittedly arsenic is a hazardous waste. How does this hazardous waste get

                monitored. The procedure is spelt out under the HW Management Rules.

                Unfortunately, the petitioner's HWM authorization was not renewed and kept

                pending for several years and ultimately rejected. The consequence of the

                same is rather disturbing. According to the petitioner they have been filing the

                returns periodically, they have been writing numerous letters to the TNPCB to

                renew their authorization but nothing happened and their application kept

                pending. The consequence that should flow out of the stalemate in the matter

                is to infer that the regulator has not examined as to the quantum of arsenic

                which has been generated in the process. From the materials placed on either

                side, it is evidently clear that the quantum of arsenic is a fluctuating figure and

                depends upon the quality of copper concentrate imported by the petitioner. As

                early as in the year 2005, the NEERI has recommended that the petitioner

                should use cleaner concentrate. The report also states that a quantity of 0.0008

                MT/day of arsenic remains unaccounted. The petitioner would state that they

                have submitted compliance report, material audit requirement has been

                complied with and they account for the arsenic input and output in the process

                and there is no un-accounting. The question is as to who will testify for the

                correctness of the stand taken by the petitioner.                Unfortunately, the

                organization which has to do the same, namely, the regulator, the TNPCB,

                appears to have not acted, presumably because the HWM authorization was

                not renewed. It is rather surprising as to how the TNPCB continued to permit

                the petitioner to operate and handle and disposed of hazardous waste without

                renewal of the authorization. Thus, we can safely conclude that there is every

                possibility of these hazardous chemicals being not accounted for, thereby

                causing hazard to the environment. The person to be blamed is the regulator

                and the regulator alone. In the earlier part of this order, we have mentioned

                that mere pendency of an application for renewal of authorization cannot be a

                license to operate. Though a valid authorization may not be a condition

                precedent for applying a consent to operate once production starts and

                hazardous waste is generated while the plant is in operation, it goes without

                saying that handling and disposal of the hazardous waste is required to be done

                in accordance with the rules and conditions stipulated in the order of

                authorization. Thus, many issues have gone unnoticed and the regulator for

                the reasons best known has not followed up the matter with earnestness

                thereby putting the people of the locality in peril.

                Management at the petitioner's Unit.          In the report submitted by the

                Monitoring Committee to the Hon'ble Supreme Court during September 2004,

                it has been stated that the petitioner has not provided adequate infrastructure

                and facilities for management of waste generated. The inspecting team found

                arsenic containing slag dumped in the factory premises in the range of several

                thousands of tonnes and there is a mountain of arsenic bearing slag and also

                phospo-gypsum. Further it is stated that there are some issues still to be

                resolved in terms of the hazardous nature of arsenic bearing ETP waste which

                were earlier contained in an inadequately designed hazardous waste land fill

                and required disposal as per the CPCB norms. The Committee was of the

                opinion that without proper assessment of the infrastructure for the

                management of hazardous waste in compliance with the directions of the

                Hon'ble Supreme Court, the environmental clearance for the proposed

                expansion should not be granted by MoEF and if it has been granted, it shall

                be revoked. The Committee also directed the TNPCB to make a detailed visit

                to the plant to ascertain whether the Unit has already proceeded with the

                expansion of the project without permission from the appropriate authority in

                which case the TNPCB shall take suitable action under the EIA notification as

                well as the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_677">Water Act</a>, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_678">Air Act</a> and HWM Rules. In the report of the NEERI

                of March 2005 with regard to the land fill No.1, it is stated that from the

                design details provided by the petitioner for land fill No.1 constructed prior to

                the year 2001 is not safe and will not secure the waste in an environmental

                friendly manner in the long run. Further it is stated that the land fill system is

                likely to pose significant threat of leaching of various constituents from the

                contained waste and contamination of ground water. Further it is stated that

                the petitioner has provided only one monitoring well and since the well is not

                being monitored regularly by the petitioner/TNPCB, the detailed assessment

                of the performance of the land fill facility was not possible during the visit.

                The analysis of ground water sample indicated presence of arsenic [0.08

                as per the Indian Drinking Water Standards thereby indicating the possible

                relief of arsenic from the land fill. Therefore, it was recommended that the

                entire quantity of waste contained in land fill No.1 along with bottom soil,

                liner mater and cover soil be removed and disposed of in a safe and secured

                land fill facility designed and developed as per the criteria given by the CPCB.

                fixed by the CPCB in February 2001 may not be applicable yet considering the

                presence of high concentration of arsenic in the waste and possibility of

                development of cracks and voids in the asphalt line in a long run, it is felt that

                a 2 cm of asphalt layer may not offer adequate protection for control of release

                of arsenic and other contaminants. It was stated that though the ground water

                samples collected showed arsenic levels within the stipulated limit, it was

                stated that the possibility of release of arsenic and other heavy metals in future

                due to deterioration of asphalt liner cannot be ruled out. Similarly, in respect

                of Cell No.2 of land fill No.2 inadequacy was pointed out. Ultimately, the

                report concludes that the land fills constructed by the petitioner prior to the

                year 2001 may not be safe and may not secure the waste in an environmental

                friendly manner in the long run. With this findings certain recommendations

                were made which are contained in paragraph 6.3.3 of the report.                     The

                petitioner would contend that the MoEF or CPCB did not issue any specific

                guidelines for the type of liner system to be followed and as per the

                recommendation of the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee, the waste

                stored in the lined pond was shifted to secured land fill constructed in the year

                2004 as per the CPCB guidelines under the supervision of the respondent

                Board. It is submitted that the technology used and the methodology adopted

                by the petitioner for the construction of the secured land fill is on par with

                TNPCB carried out efficacy of the existing land fill in the year 2006 and it was

                observed to be confirming with requirements. Further it is reiterated that the

                design measures adopted by the petitioner are at par with global standards

                which are followed by all industries in India. The liner system are designed

                and constructed and installed to prevent mitigation of waste leachate to the

                adjacent sub-surface soil, ground water or surface water.              Further it is

                operated without authorization and have not submitted the manifest for

                scrubber cake, it is submitted that the petitioner has been in compliance with

                the consent conditions issued by the TNPCB and has taken efforts disposed

                down, entire spent catalyst has been replaced with new catalyst which resulted

                in higher quantity of hazardous waste generation and the petitioner has

                disclosed the details of the quantity of spent catalyst generated in their HW

                Annual Return in Form No.4.         Further, it is submitted that when the

                application for renewal of authorization was pending, the petitioner once again

                reapplied for authorization on 28.04.2015 including additional list of waste

                and these wastes are generated in a very small quantity during plant

                maintenance usually kept in stores for giving back to supplier. Over a period

                of time this got accumulated and hence it was decided to dispose of them in

                installed as per the TNPCB direction. With regard to the allegation that all of

                a sudden in the HW approval application 15 MT of lead scales have been

                mentioned, it is submitted that lead scale will be generated once a while after

                expiry of lead anodes in the copper refinery and not generated on regular

                interval and hence not mentioned in the 2017 application. With regard to the

                allegation that ETP slime containing Nickel was disposed of to M/s.Suhans

                Chemicals without they having authorization for handling such waste. It is

                submitted that the said recycler is authorized for Nickel based residues by the

                Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and therefore they are authorized to deal

                with the said waste, thus the petitioner would contend that they have complied

                with all formalities required by furnishing a comprehensive list of hazardous

                waste which is never disclosed by other industries and now the petitioner is

                targeted for doing so. The petitioner adopts the national/international practices

                while handling hazardous waste such as ETP cake.

                the NEERI coupled with the facts disclosed by the petitioner would show that

                substantial amount of arsenic bearing slag had been improperly handled by the

                petitioner and the petitioner had to remove the hazardous waste dumped in the

                SLF and shift it to a new facility. This according to the petitioner is due

                compliance of the recommendation made by the Supreme Court Monitoring

                Committee.             However, considering the matter from an environmental

                perspective, what is required to be seen is the impact on environment caused

                on account of improperly lined pond/SLF. The fact that the petitioner in the

                year 2004 rectified the infrastructural deficiency cannot nullify the hazardous

                effect on environment caused on account of the improper design of the SLF.

                By removing the hazardous waste which was dumped in the SLF which design

                was found to be faulty may be a step to ensure that post 2004 there may not be

                any issues. But the fact remains that it remained dumped in the improperly

                designed land fill for quite a number of years and it can be easily perceived

                about the damage that would have been caused to the environment with

                particular reference to the ground water contaminant. While applying renewal

                of HW authorization during May 2014 additional list of wastes were

                mentioned. The explanation given by the petitioner that these wastes are

                generated in very small quantity during plant maintenance and they are usually

                kept in stores for giving back to the supplier is not a convincing explanation.

                The fact that such additional waste continue to remain in the factory, in store

                and ultimately disposed of in the SLF would go to show that they were

                hazardous waste. Similarly lead scales were not mentioned earlier and for the

                first time included in the renewal application submitted during 2017, the

                explanation offered is that it is not generated in regular intervals and that is

                why it was not mentioned in the application. We find this explanation being

                far from satisfactory. From the details furnished with regard to M/s.Suhans

                Chemicals, we find that they are not authorized to handle all category of waste

                generated by the petitioner as admitted by the petitioner themselves that they

                are recyclers of Nickel based residues. In any event the authorization given by

                the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board does not prima facie show that

                M/s.Suhans Chemical are authorized to recycle the large quantity of waste

                generated by the petitioner. We make such observation because in the order of

                consent dated 01.08.2017 granted by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board

                to M/s.Suhans Chemicals Private Limited that they are authorized to

                manufacture Nickel Catalyst with maximum quantity of 240 tonnes per

                annum, Nickel salt of 48 tonnes per annum and as per the conditions in the

                said consent order they can accept and process spent catalyst containing

                Nickel – 610MF per annum as raw material. Thus, we find that the TNPCB

                had failed to properly monitor the Hazardous Waste Management procedures

                adopted by the petitioner, which ultimately boils down to the fact that the

                hazardous waste authorization was not renewed and yet the petitioner

                continued to carry on production, generate and handle hazardous waste. The

                fact as to whether the authorization/consent granted to M/s.Suhans Chemicals

                Obviously the said Company would not be exclusively handling the waste

                generated by the petitioner alone as there is nothing on record to indicate any

                such arrangement. Thus, the consented capacity can hardly be stated to have

                been exclusively used for the waste generated by the petitioner. That apart,

                the consent order given to M/s.Suhans Chemicals is for Nickel based waste

                and the question is as to what about the other waste which also form part of

                the waste generated. Therefore, we find that the explanation offered in this

                regard is far from satisfactory and not convincing.          Once again it is the

                regulator who has to be held responsible for not carrying out their statutory

                duty in a proper manner. Thus the abundance of materials available before us

                convinces us to apply the doctrine as propounded by the Hon'ble Supreme

                Court that even if there is to be an error in the assessment it would be better to

                err rather than to give a clean chit to the petitioner as there are several

                inadequacies which have been pointed out, some of it are claimed to have been

                defect continued to exist.     Therefore, the hazardous waste management

                procedures adopted by the petitioner are far from being satisfactory.

                said incident, nor the petitioner attempts to state that some other industry is the

                cause and not themselves. Therefore, the incident cannot be disbelieved and it

                is held that there was admittedly a spike in the gas, which has caused hardship

                to the public, which resulted in a panic situation in the area, which has

                compelled the Revenue Administration to issue a press release. From the

                press release, it is seen that responsibility was fixed on the petitioner resulting

                in an order of closure of the industry for a period of five days by exercising

                recorded were as a result of a calibration exercise, or was it actual emission

                value. We are surprised to see that the calibration reports, prepared by the

                petitioner, who claims to function with state of art technology, are hand

                written reports. A bunch of reports have been filed by the petitioner in their

                typed set and all of them are hand written. When the petitioner points out that

                the equipments of the Board and other assessment made by them should be

                done properly, it goes without saying that the petitioner is also under an

                obligation to ensure that fair and appropriate steps are taken by them. When a

                dispute arises as to whether it was a calibration exercise or an actual emission,

                should be able to do so with sufficient documents. In such factual scenario,

                when hand written documents are relied on, it gives room for suspicion.

                recorded and the petitioner should have ensured that no tampering can take

                place in such electronic record. However, the petitioner places much reliance

                on hand written calibration exercise reports. We are not convinced to accept

                such reports more particularly, when the situation is very sensitive and public

                not true representation of actual reading and it only denotes the calibration gas

                value fed to the analyser. Thus, the petitioner would candidly admit that

                intimation regarding a calibration exercise was not given to the TNPCB,

                rather, they would refer to the instructions given by the equipment

                manufacturer (OE Supplier) and that TNPCB should be aware of the fact

                than one reason. Firstly, the calibration exercise is not an exercise, which is

                unregulated, as the CPCB has issued instructions in the form of guidelines for

                Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring Systems (OCEMS). In para 5.4 which

                deals with “quantification”, instrument calibration has been mentioned in para

                5.4.2. The report in protocol is contained in para 6.0 and data management

                6.1. Therefore, the guidelines, which have been framed by the CPCB have to

                sending communication to the Board only during long shut down activity and

                not during intermittent stoppage        appears to be highly unprofessional.

                Shutting down a plant of such magnitude has been explained to us by the

                learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner to be a very elaborate and a technical

                exercise. If that is so, then re-starting such a plant is equally or more serious

                an exercise. The stoppage of the plant as was admitted by the petitioner was

                due to puncture in the furnace roof cooling jacket tube.                 The technical

                problem, which had occurred, appears to be not a minor problem or otherwise,

                the petitioner would have had alternate methods to attend such problems

                without requiring the plant to be shut down. Therefore, we hold that the

                petitioner should have intimated about the stoppage though according to them,

                entertained. If the said Professor was part of an inspecting team constituted by

                the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the petitioner can hardly question his competence

                and independence more so when, the petitioner did not object to him being

                part of the Committee constituted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Therefore,

                we hold that the objection raised by the petitioner on the opinion of the

                Professor to be not tenable. Sans technical aspects mentioned in the report

                what strikes our eye is the statement that the symptoms reported are consistent

                with symptoms triggered by exposure to SO2. The intensity of symptoms

                reported from Thoothukudi town correspond to SO2 levels above acute

                exposure guideline values (AEGL-I and II) laid down by the United States

                Environment Protection Agency.           The Professor has taken note of the low

                wind speed, that is, 1.22 kmph and states that it corresponds with the sequence

                of events and the timing of concept of symptoms reported by the residents of

                Thoothukudi.           The fact that between 05.50 am to 06.05 am, the on-line

                than 60 ug/m cannot be denied by the petitioner. There is no explanation or

                plausible explanation given by the petitioner for such sudden sharp spike. The

                readings on two previous dates did not show anything abnormal. It has been

                pointed out that data from the monitor is not available after 10.15 am and it is

                stated that this is curious and raises a question as to why the monitor stopped

                working precisely around the time of the second instance, that is, 09.15 am to

                11.15 am that the Care Air Centre recorded SO2 level in excess of 1123.6

                PPM. That apart, the petitioner is the sole large emitter of SO2 upwind of

                Thoothukudi town as per the meteorological data available.                  Thus, the

                Professor concludes by stating that he is of the opinion that evidences strongly

                point towards the petitioner, as the source of emissions responsible for the

                acute exposure effects on 23.03.2013.

                The calibration report provided records the values as 5 PPM and 6 PPM for

                gas diluted from 4000 PPM standards, the report records 1004 PPM before

                calibration and 1000 PPM after calibration. The question which the expert has

                posed is, if these were the cases, the same numbers ought to have been

                displayed in the Care Air Centre. The display in the Care Air Centre recorded

                1104.2 PPM,            1123.6 PPM and 803.5 PPM more importantly, the levels

                reflected in the Care Air Centre's display reflects the maximum recordable

                levels of the device and not the readings during calibration. The upper end of

                the range measurement is 1123.6 PPM, emissions above that, even if they

                exceed the level, will not be recorded and the only way to deduce the intensity

                of the emission is by gauging the nature and extent of symptoms among

                exposed population.

                notification dated 16.11.2009 cannot be applied to the present fact situation,

                where there has been a public out cry, action had to be initiated under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_685">Section

                133</a> Cr.P.C., to abate the nuisance.          The Revenue Divisional Officer has

                recorded statements from the public, Professor, Doctors, etc., and to state that

                the MoEF grants two days time for action to be initiated even if there is an

                excess, is an argument which has to be out rightly rejected.

                in the report. No material has been placed before us to show that the petitioner

                has disputed the report at an earlier point of time and when this has been

                pointed out before this Court, it is the petitioner's case that the report as a

                whole does not indicate any health concern due to the operation of the

                petitioner's unit. The duty to provide a clean and health living atmosphere is

                TNPCB.           Therefore, the burden is on the petitioner to prove that their

                operations are benign. Unfortunately, the appropriate authorities of the State

                appear to have not given a serious thought to the health aspect of the general

                public living in and around the industry. No material was placed before us to

                show as to how the health monitoring reports submitted once in six months are

                processed. Whether the TNPCB has a team of medical experts or it referred to

                the District Medical Hospital etc.         Thus, we would be well justified in

                considering that the periodical reports said to have been submitted by the

                periodical health reports, but submission of such reports to the authorities is

                not sufficient, but what is required is cross verification, which appears to have

                not been done. Thus, a deeper probe into this issue is required and as to what

                discharge of untreated effluent by the tanneries and other industries in the

                State of Tamil Nadu. The Hon'ble Supreme Court issued directions to NEERI

                to send a team of experts to examine the feasibility of setting up of Common

                Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs). NEERI submitted a report stating that

                water samples collected from dug-wells near tannery cluster are unfit for

                drinking and the water in Palar river downstream from the place where

                effluent is discharged, is highly polluted. Therefore, the Court directed all the

                tanneries in five Districts in the State of Tamil Nadu to be closed with

                immediate effect. The matter was being monitored by the Hon'ble Supreme

                to control the pollution generated by them.      The Court took note of the

                economic consequences and the employment avenues and pointed out that the

                leather industry in India has become a major foreign exchange earner and

                Tamil Nadu was the leading exporter of finished leather accounting for

                approximately 80% of the country's export, that though the leather industry is

                of vital importance to the country, as it generates foreign exchange and

                provides employment avenues, it has no right to destroy the ecology, degrade

                the environment and pose a health hazard. It cannot be permitted to expand or

                even continue with the production, unless it tackles by itself the problem of

                pollution created by the said industry (emphasis supplied). It was further

                pointed out that the traditional concept that development and ecology are

                opposed to each other is no longer acceptable and “sustainable development”

                is the answer. Explaining further, it was pointed out that some of the salient

                degradation; where there are threats of serious and irreversible damage, lack of

                Principle” and the “Polluter Pays Principle” have been accepted as part of

                environmental law of the country. Discussing about the EP Act, it was held

                that the main purpose of the Act is to create an authority or authorities under

                by the ancient Roman Empire - “Doctrine of Public Trust”. The said doctrine

                was explained by observing that it primarily rests on the principle that certain

                resources like air, sea, waters and forests have such a great importance to the

                people as a whole that it would be wholly unjustified to make them a subject

                of private ownership. The resources being, a gift of nature, they should be

                made freely available to everyone irrespective of status in life., the said

                doctrine enjoins upon the Government to protect the resources for the

                enjoyment of the general public, rather than to permit their use for private

                ownership or commercial purposes. It was pointed out that protection of

                argument that ecology and environment protection is a relevant factor to

                determine which lands, waters or airs are protected by the public doctrine. It

                was held that there is no reason as to why the “public trust doctrine” should

                not be expanded to include all ecosystems operating in our natural resources.

                Further, our legal system, based on English Common Law, includes the

                “public trust doctrine” as part of its jurisprudence. The State is the trustee of

                all natural resources, which are by nature meant for public use and enjoyment.

                The State as a Trustee is under a legal duty to protect the natural resources. It

                was held that one who pollutes the environment must pay to reverse the

                damage caused by its act and “public trust doctrine” was made part of the law

                was pointed out that in the environment field, the uncertainty of scientific

                opinion has created serious problems for the Courts. After referring to certain

                decisions of the United States Supreme Court, it was held that uncertainty

                becomes a problem, when scientific knowledge is institutionalized in policy

                making or used as a basis for decision-making by agencies and Courts.

                Scientists may refine, modify or discard variables or models, when more

                information is available; however, agencies and Courts must make choices

                based on existing scientific knowledge. In addition, agency decision-making

                evidence is generally presented in a scientific form that cannot be easily tested.

                Therefore, inadequacies in the record due to uncertainty or insufficient

                knowledge, may not be properly considered. It was further held that the

                inadequacies of science result from identification of adverse effects of a

                hazard and then working backwards to find the causes; secondly, where

                clinical tests         are performed, where toxins are involved; and thirdly,

                conclusions based on epidemiological studies are flawed by the scientist's

                inability to control or even accurately assess past exposure of the subject. It

                was further pointed out that it is the above uncertainty of science in the

                environmental context, that has led international conferences to formulate new

                legal theories and rules of evidence. The Court referred to the “Precautionary

                Principles” and the new burden of proof in Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum

                case and explained the meaning in more detail so that, Courts and Tribunals or

                Environmental Authorities can properly apply the said principles in the

                matters, which come before them.        It was held that the “Precautionary

                Principle” has replaced the assimilative capacity principle and in order to

                protect environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by

                States according to their capabilities, where there are threats of serious or

                irreversible damages, lack of scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason

                for postponing cost effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.

                The Court referred to an Article by Charmian Barton with regard to the cause

                for emergence of the said principle, wherein, the learned author had stated that

                there is nothing to prevent decision-makers from assessing the record and

                concluding that there is inadequate information on which to reach a

                determination. If it is not possible to make a decision with “some” confidence,

                then it makes sense to err on the side of caution and prevent activities that may

                cause serious or irreversible harm. The “Principle of Precaution” was further

                explained by stating that it involves the anticipation of environmental harm

                and taking measures to avoid it or to choose the least environmentally harmful

                activity.         It is based on scientific uncertainty (emphasis supplied).

                Environmental protection should not only aim at protecting health, property

                and economic interest, but also protect the environment for its own sake.

                Precautionary duties must not only be triggered by the suspicion of concrete

                danger, but also by concern of risk potential (emphasis supplied). While

                dealing with the issue pertaining to burden of proof, the Hon'ble Supreme

                Court held that the “Precautionary Principle” suggests that where there is an

                identifiable risk of serious or irreversible harm, for example widespread toxic

                pollution, it may be appropriate to place the burden of proof on the person or

                the entity proposing the activity, that is, potentially harmful to environment. If

                insufficient evidence is presented by them to alleviate concern about the level

                of uncertainty, then the presumption should operate in favour of environment

                protection. The Court dealt with the duty of the present generation towards

                posterity: Principle of Inter-Generational Equity: and Rights of the Future

                against the Present. The Court referred to principles 1 and 2 of the Stockholm

                declaration wherein, the environment is viewed more as a resource basis for

                the survival of the present and future generations (emphasis supplied).

                that the risk of harm to the environment or to human health is to be decided in

                public interest according to “reasonable persons”. While considering as to

                which would take precedence for protection, the Court pointed out that in case

                of doubt, protection of an environment would have precedence over the

                economic interest. “Precautionary Principle” requires anticipatory action to be

                taken to prevent harm. The harm can be prevented even on a reasonable

                suspicion, it is not always necessary that there should be direct evidence of

                followed the said decision in several cases issuing directions and ensuring its

                enforcement by nothing short of demolition or restoration of status quo ante.

                That the fact that crores of rupees has already been spent on development

                by nature/ecology with or without mitigation. Therefore, in such matters, the

                required standard is that the risk of harm to the environment or to human

                case is a quest for environmental governance within a rule of law paradigm.

                Environmental governance is founded on the need to promote environmental

                sustainability as a crucial enabling factor which ensures the health of our

                international community adopted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development

                and its 17 SDGs.             It was observed that each of these goals has a vital

                the Government should safeguard the environment. No two environmental

                issues can be alike, even if the polluter or the enterprise carries on the same

                activity. Pollution can be in different forms, having varied impacts. The

                location of the enterprise, climatic conditions, effect on ecology can never be

                similar in all cases. Thus, even if a common bench mark is laid down, it can,

                at best, be regarded as a broad parameter, specifics are necessarily to be taken

                note of, which would involve multiple factors. Therefore, we need to apply

                the broad principles of environmental jurisprudence, which has been evolved

                by the Hon'ble Supreme Court over four decades and the common thread

                which runs in all these decisions is to preserve the environment for the “future-

                inter- generational equity”. If there is uncertainty in scientific opinion, it

                would be appropriate to err on the side of caution. The theory of sustainable

                development has been eloquently explained, the development of law on the

                said aspect and, the ultimate conclusion arrived at in all the decisions is that

                environmental protection is always at a higher pedestal compared to economic

                interest.

                Certain articles also have been referred to in support of their contention that

                dangerous. We have also noted that laboratory tests and opinions are rendered

                on idealistic situations and not in case where several lakh tons of copper slag

                have been indiscriminately dumped, left to lie open to the fury of nature for

                nearly a decade. Therefore, there is definitely a scientific uncertainty on the

                effect of the copper slag as to how the beneficial uses can be undertaken etc.

                Therefore, we have no hesitation to hold that the respondent-State and the

                Regulator would be well justified in invoking the “Precautionary Principle”

                bearing in mind the aspect of sustainable development. In fact, in the 2013

                judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the petitioner has been held to be a

                polluter, and applying the “Polluter Pays Principle”, a sum of Rs.100 crores

                was directed to be paid. Therefore, the Doctrine of Sustainable Development,

                Precautionary Principle and the Polluter Pays Principle needs to be applied to

                the case on hand. If applied, facts speak for themselves, petitioner needs to be

                closed and permanently sealed.

                public and private properties are resorted to.          After referring to those

                guidelines, it was pointed out that the fundamental purpose is that there cannot

                orders and it prima facie appears that in tune with the observations made by

                would admit with a caveat that the protesters, protested against their proposed

                On 26.03.2013, one employee of the petitioner, who was native of Bihar, had

                factual position and the challenge to the very establishment of the industry

                commenced in the year 1996, much prior to the industry starting commercial

                production. Ever since then, apart from local protests and agitations, which

                were in a small way, much of the time was spent in Courts either at the

                instance of the public interest litigations or at the instance of the petitioner.

                Therefore, we cannot accept the stand taken by the petitioner that the

                impugned orders are knee-jerk reactions, especially the order of closure. The

                public cannot be shut out, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_708">Amendment Act</a> 47 of 1981 has emphasised the role

                of the public and recognised public participation. We have also noted that for

                a substantial period of time, the petitioner had been operating without a valid

                consent and on the strength of the stay orders granted by the Court/Tribunal.

                In the 2013 judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had appreciated the efforts

                of the public interest litigants and NGOs in taking up the cause of environment

                especially, against an organisation like the petitioner, which is undoubtedly a

                very large organisation with sufficient resources.          The ultimatum was

                announcing a 100 day protest and the decision of the protesters to lay siege to

                petitioner, who had approached the Madurai Bench of this Court twice for

                virtually the same relief. It is not for the petitioner to state as to when the

                in the discussions which were had by way of peace committee meetings by the

                officials, we find that TNPCB was not a party to any of the discussions.

                Several persons had been detained under the <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_710">Tamil Nadu Act</a>, 14 of 1982 by

                way of preventive detention, which orders were quashed by the Madurai

                Bench. Therefore, we hold that the orders rejecting the application for grant of

                consent, directing closure, permanent sealing of the petitioner industry cannot

                be treated as knee-jerk reaction pursuant to the unfortunate shooting incident,

                but it is a culmination of various issues solely attributable to the petitioner.

                are generally located in third world countries and even in those countries it is

                not located in areas inhabited by people. The State has taken a stand that the

                therefore, the plant can be shut. The impleaded respondent would state that

</p><p id="p_1038">                               576.From the above submissions on either side, what emerges is that

                the State and the TNPCB have taken a categorical stand that all is not well

                with the petitioner Unit. Reference to affidavits which were filed in 1997 by

                Mo&amp;EF supporting the petitioner may not help them. We had noted that in

                September 2004 the Committee appointed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court

                visited the petitioner Unit as well as other red category industries in the

                Country. The Committed makes a specific observation to the effect that the

                petitioner has not provided adequate infrastructure and facilities for

                management of the waste generated.             The Committee was particularly

                concerned with the issues relating to disposal of arsenic contained slag which

                was found dumped in the factory premises in the range of several thousands of

                tonnes and the Committed noted that there is a maintenance of arsenic bearing

                slag and also a mountain of phospogypsum.              It was pointed out that if

                phospogypsum is not contained properly, it occasionally becomes airborne and

                poplulation. Further, the Committed pointed out that there are some issue

                stills to be resolved in terms of the hazardous nature of arsenic bearing ETP

                waste which were earlier contained in an inadequately designed hazardous

                waste land fill and require disposal as per CPCB guidelines. Further the

                petitioner reported to the Committee during their visit that they are also

                emitting Sulphurdioxide far in excess of the permissible standards particularly

                when the sulphuric acid plant is not operating. The inadequacies which were

                observed by the Committee had made them to render finding that since the

                wastes were not properly managed, they have resulted in adverse impact on

                the environment including the health of the people. The Committee directed

                the concerned authority of the Government of Tamil Nadu to conduct a

                detailed environmental audit of the Unit and to assessee the efficacy of its

                environmental management practices by an independent agency.                    What

                against the regulator, TNPCB or did not the Committee have faith in the

                Governmental machinery of the State of Tamil Nadu or did they doubt the

                bonafides of the officials of the Government and the TNPCB. These questions

                have remained unanswered and the TNPCB have been renewing the concerns

                required to note is the permitted operating capacity and the average amount of

                slag that will be generated. Experts have stated that about 2 to 2.2 tonnes of

                copper slag is generated for every one ton of copper annode manufacture.

                This figure is taken for illustrative purpose as the petitioner may take a stand

                that it depends upon the quality of the ore and such factors. The petitioner's

                permitted production capacity is 1200 tonnes per day and the approximate slag

                that will be generated per day will be 2400 tonnes which totals to about

                800,000 tonnes per year given the optimum functioning of the factory. This

                staggering figure shocks the system.

                have conducted a study of the area between 12.10.2018 and 15.10.2018. This

                report is objected by the petitioner on all angles and terming the same to be an

                unscientific study. This report is again by a private agency which states that

                the soil samples drawn in 12 locations show that they are impacted by varying

                degrees of heavy metal contamination which is due to indiscriminate dumping

                of copper slag by the petitioner. The report recommends certain sites to be

                declared as contaminated sights which would mean that it cannot be put to use

                for any purpose for all the years to come. Thus the larger question would be

                as to whom the Court should trust. On the one hand, the regulator took a firm

                stand. NEERI submitted reports are were adverse to the petitioner. Thereafter

                on further direction being issued, the TNPCB curiously took a stand that only

                thirty conditions need to be laid down. The stand taken by the expert body

                which was given the full liberty by the Hon'ble Supreme Court to give their

                comments on the report accepted the stand of the regulator, TNPCB and issued

                directions. Now the TNPCB states that all the conditions which are to be

                cumulatively complied, have not been done by the petitioner. Can this lead to

                an inference that TNPCB was guilty of not placing the full facts before the

                Hon'ble Supreme Court in the 2013 case. We have held that the past conduct

                of the petitioner should be and can be taken into consideration by the regulator

                and while deciding the correctness of the orders passed by the regulator and

                the Government, the Court also is empowered to take note of the past conduct.

                We have assigned reasons in support of such conclusion. Hence, the stand

                taken by the petitioner that they are state of art Unit with utmost commitment

                to the environment and society is hard to believe. The Courts have their

                limitation when it comes to examining highly technical issues and this is why

                the Constitutional Courts have circumscribed a self imposed restriction on

                judicial review of executive action. The problem which is very peculiar to the

                case on hand is as to whom to believe. Why do we say so? This is because of

                the inconsistency of the authorities at various levels at different points of time.

                Probably this prompted one of the impleaded respondent to take a stand that he

                will pursue his claim independently and seek for sustaining the order of

                closure regardless of party in power in the State. If Courts are left to doubt

                every technical report relied on by the regulator, it would lead to a disastrous

                The defendant therein was a copper smelter and there were five charges

                against them having breached the conditions of the Environment Protection

                License. As contended by the petitioner before us, the defendant smelter

                therein took a stand that the risk assessment process has been carried out in a

                reasonable manner and there was no inadequacies in the acid plant risk

                assessment having regard to the current standards and that the Court was

                advocating a standard of perfection in a hind sight. The Court observed that

                the very fact that the smelter was adopting a new and complex technology in

                an operation involving potentially harmful gases should have required a great

                deal of attention to be paid to risk assessment and to the possibility that

                incidents would occur during the commission period and that the possibility of

                the license emission limit would be exceeded on each occasion was reasonable

                foreseeable and as a result each of the incidents could have been prevented.

                Limited [(1999) NSWLEC 14], the defendant Company had committed an

                offence of polluting of waters of Murray river by introducing solid waste and

                ethanol contrary to the Clean Waters Act. The Court observed the fact that the

                defendant held a license [which permitted a discharge which did not contain

                more than 45mg/L of non-filterable residue at various point adjacent to the

                boundaries of the premises; ethanol was not referred to specifically in license

                condition] heightened its responsibility to keep the level of discharge from the

                premises within the parameters set by the license.

                on extraneous consideration it is a colourable exercise of power and for

                political considerations. Though in several places, the petitioner pleads mala

                fides, it has not been proved in the manner known to law. Does the petitioner

                state that the State Government has acted mala fide, if so, what is the

                foundation of such a plea. If the petitioner states that the TNPCB's action is

                mala fide it should establish as to which officer or which authority of the

                regulator acted mala fide. Thus, mere use of the expression mala fide would

                not make the decision a mala fide exercise of power. Equally we find that

                there is no colourable exercise of power rather it is a belated exercise of

                power. We have commented upon the inadequacies in the infrastructure of the

                TNPCB and also observed that the magnitude of the petitioner was a big

                deterrent not only to the regulator TNPCB but to the District Administration

                and the officers of the Government at various levels. If the petitioner makes a

                statement that the order of closure is for political consideration, then it needs

                to be examined as to how the petitioner was able to secure an approval from

                Thoothukudi when they were unable to do so in two other States in India. In

                fact, the Division Bench while ordering closure had commented upon the fast

                track procedure. In the 2013 judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court this

                issue came up for consideration and it was pointed out that the notification

                issued under the EP Act provided for a rapid environment impact assessment

                could done. The petitioner while stating that the impugned order was passed

                for political consideration stated that the order was passed to divert the public

                attention from the mishandling by the State and the officials are ultimately

                lead to the shooting incident. This averment is required to be outrightly

                rejected as vague and devoid of any substance.            We had made certain

                observations as regards the order passed under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_714">Section 144</a> Cr.P.C. Such

                order was at the behest of the petitioner when they approached the Madurai

                Bench of this Court by way of two writ petitions virtually for an identical

                relief. In the instant case, an order under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_715">Section 144</a> Cr.P.C., was passed and

                under normal circumstances, such order is passed to protect the public and

                public properties and not to protect a private asset as that of the case on hand.

                This appears to be unprecedented. Therefore, if according to the petitioner the

                order of closure is for political consideration, then it goes without saying that

                the order granting permission to establish the Unit twenty years ago is also for

                political considerations. We refrain from making any further observation in

                this regard.

                             no fair reason for the law which would not require with equal

                             force its extension to those whom it leaves untouched. What,

                             then, are the fair reasons for non-extension ? What should a

                             classification in areas relating to economic and tax matters.

                             Should it, by its judgment, force the legislature to choose

                             after. Therefore, this ominous period lends itself to legislative

                             segregation and special treatment. Mr. Justice Mathew has

                             explored the jurisprudence of selective treatment as consistent

                             with the pragmatism of eglitarianism. The present Bill is a

                                 occur, what evasions might develop, what new evils

                                 might be generated in the attempt. Administrative

                                 expedients must be forged and tested. Legislators,

                                 recognizing these factors, may wish to proceed

                                 cautiously, and courts must allow them to do so

                                 fide. It is well settled that the burden of proving mala

                                 fide is on the person making the allegations and the

                                 burden is "very heavy". (vide <a href="/doc/1327287/" id="a_735">E.P. Royappa v. State of

                                 favour of the administration that the power has been

                                 exercised bona fide and in good faith. It is to be

                                 remembered that the allegations of mala fide are often

                                 more easily made than made out and the very

</p><p id="p_1092">                               599.In the light of the above discussion, we are of the clear view that

                the petitioner has not been able to establish that the impugned decisions are

                malafide or on account the extraneous consideration or political consideration

                or a colourable exercise of power. The petitioner being the biggest in the area

                cannot plead that they have been singled out and victimized when they have

                been found to be a violator.          This observation will equally apply to the

                argument of the petitioner that 101 red category industries do not have

                authorization under HW Rules. This is a sorry state of affairs, the reasons are

                unknown but that can hardly be an argument to exonerate the petitioner.

                industry, but it cannot seal the entire industry bringing every unoffending

                activity to a standstill. We are afraid that this decision can hardly apply to the

                facts of the present case. In the said decision, the complaint was against a

                small part of the business carried on by the appellant therein, where casting of

                iron components using furnace was carried on from a premises residential in

                nature. The petitioner is a red category industry, the establishments, which are

                located within the factory complex are inextricable and to be treated as a

                single establishment and that is how the petitioner has perceived the same.

                The power plant is a unit for captive power generation and its location is

                within the same premises. Therefore, the argument that those independent

                units cannot be closed is an argument that needs to be rejected. The petitioner

                cannot be heard to say that an ancillary unit, ancillary to a main unit, should be

                permitted to function when the main unit has been locked, sealed and directed

                to be dismantled. Therefore, we reject such submission.

</p><p id="p_1094">                               601.We had earlier discussed the issue as regards the power of the

                State Government to permanently close and seal the petitioner industry. It was

                the argument on behalf of the petitioner that there is no such power vested

                under <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_738">Section 18</a> of the Act. We have assigned reasons as to how such

                submission is not acceptable by reading all the relevant provisions of the Air

                and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_739">Water Act</a>s, which confer all powers, which are incidental and

                consequential. In this regard, it would be beneficial to refer to the decision of

                the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Khargram Panchayat Samiti. The question,

                which fell for consideration was whether the Panchayat Samiti, which had

                authority to grant licence for holding a fair, had the consequential or incidental

                power to specify a day for holding such fair. The High Court held that the

                Panchayat Samiti had power to grant licence, but had no consequential or

                incidental power to specify a date for holding of such fair. Reversing the said

                decision, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the power to grant the licence

                for holding a fair includes the power to make incidental or consequential

                orders for specification of a day on which such fair shall be held; the statutory

                bodies like the Panchayat enjoy a wide incidental power, that is, they may do

                everything which is calculated to facilitate or is conducive or incidental to the

                discharge of any of their functions and the doctrine of ultra vires is not to be

                applied narrowly. Further, it was pointed out that it is well accepted that the

                conferral of statutory powers on the local authorities must be construed as

                impliedly authorising everything which would fairly and reasonably be

                regarded as incidental or consequential to the power itself.                The relevant

                setup by the petitioner. The said Smt.C.M.Vijayalakshmi, at no earlier point

                of time, had sought to get herself involved in the litigation and her submission

                petitioner. This averment is sufficient to doubt the bona fides of the petitioner.

                              reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right. Out of

                judgment in rem and there should be finality to litigation. Further, it was

                contended that doctrine of res judicata applies to <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_758">Article 32</a> petitions, when

                the same was a matter decided under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_759">Article 226</a> by the High Court. The

                above decisions set down the legal principles. When we apply these principles

                to the case on hand, we need to examine as to its applicability. To decide this

                issue, the factual matrix is the predominant material, to come to a conclusion

                as to whether the principles of constructive res judicata, substantive res

                judicata will apply.

                be twice vexed on the same cause. This submission is predicated on the

                contention that the 2013 judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court puts an end

                given reasons to do so and the reasons are manifest on a reading of the 2013

                judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. In our view, the proper reading of

                the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is to hold that the regulator has

                power to take action including ordering closure.




</p><p id="p_1114">                               608.The respondent-State is right in their submission that the 2013

                judgment arose out of an order of the Court directing closure whereas, the

                impugned orders in these writ petitions are orders refusing to renew the

                consent to operate by the TNPCB and an order of permanent closure by the

                Government followed by further orders by the TNPCB. Therefore, the two

                situations, that is, the situations which prevailed before the Division Bench of

                the High Court while ordering closure, the correctness of this was tested by the

                Hon'ble Supreme Court in the 2013 judgment and the present impugned orders

                are two different situations. Therefore, the 2013 judgment of the Hon'ble

                Suprme Court cannot be a bar for the authorities issuing directions for closure.

                Hon'ble Supreme Court in the 2013 judgment. Therefore, on facts, we hold

                that the doctrine of res judicata can have no application to the facts of this

                case and it is not a case where the matter has been determined in a former

                proceedings and therefore, it is not open to the parties to re-agitate the matter

                again.        At this juncture, it would be worthwhile to refer to the relevant

                paragraphs of the 2013 judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which read as

                                 It will be clear from the extracts from the Executive

                                 parameters stipulated under drinking water standards,

                                 whereas the heavy metal concentrations, namely, iron,

                                 manganese, zinc and arsenic were within the drinking

                                 water standards. Soil samples also revealed heavy

                                 metals. Regarding the solid waste out of slag in the

                                 plant site, the CPCB has taken a view in its

                                 communication dated 17.11.2003 to TNPCB that the

                                 slag is non- hazardous. Thus, the NEERI report of

                                 2005 did show that the emission and effluent discharge

                                 affected the environment but the report read as whole

                                 does not warrant a conclusion that the plant of the

                                 appellants could not possibly take remedial steps to

                                 improve the environment and that the only remedy to

                                 protect the environment was to direct closure of the

                                 plant of the appellants.

                matters. The orders passed by the Board refusing consent to operate sets out

                reasons and also refers to the earlier general and special conditions. For 20

                long years, the petitioner has being issued such orders, be it a closure order or

                a renewal order. The petitioner was closed twice by TNPCB and thrice by the

                Court. The matter being a technical matter, the Environmental Engineer of the

                TNPCB cannot be expected to write a judgment, nor the petitioner can expect

                him to do so. Non-compliance, violation, partial compliance or total disregard

                to the conditions would empower the Board to take action against the licensee

                and such action can be an action to stop, action to close down till the breach is

                remedied, action to close permanently in cases, which warrant such action and

                action for permanent closure and removal. Therefore, the impugned orders

                cannot be stated to be devoid of reasons, as the Government Order while

                endorsing the closure order of the Pollution Control Board, directs permanent

                closure and sealing of the unit and has referred to the mandate cast on the State

                by the Constitution and bearing in mind the larger public interest.

                Supreme Court in TNPCB vs. Sterlite Industries C.A.Nos.4763-4764/2013

                dated 18.02.2019. The judgments of the NGT both interim and final orders

                setting aside the order of closure passed by the TNPCB were set aside on the

                ground of maintainability. The consequential order passed by the TNPCB

                dated 22.01.2019 was also set aside. The Hon'ble Supreme Court relegated the

                petitioner to the position that the six orders impugned before the NGT, dealt

                with in its order dated 15.12.2018 and the order dated 29.03.2013 dealt with in

                the final order dated 08.08.2013 are alive and operative. The Hon'ble Supreme

                Court observed that it will be open for the petitioner herein to file a writ

                petition in the High Court against all the aforesaid orders. Thus, the entire

                order/judgment of NGT has been set aside in toto, the orders which were

                impugned before the NGT having been resurrected leaving it open to the

                petitioner to file writ petitions against those orders. Therefore, by virtue of the

                judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 18.02.2018, the clock has been

                set back to the position which prevailed in 2013.              Therefore, the entire

                proceedings before the NGT should be held to be non-existing as on date and

                completely effaced. Therefore, we cannot refer to the affidavits, reports or any

                observations made before the NGT. In other words, the “slate” has been

                cleaned and there are no writings on it to rely on.

                and the State of Goa to take steps to terminate the mining leases, where mining

                was carried out in violation of various statutes. The Court pointed out that in

                renewing the mining leases, the State of Goa completely ignored several

                relevant, important and significant factors giving the impression that renewals

                were not quite fair or reasonable; the State ignored the fact that every single

                mining lease holder (including the petitioner) have committed some illegality

                or other in varying degrees.        To identify these illegalities, a Special

                Investigating Team had been set up as also a team of Chartered Accountants

                and instead of waiting for a report from one of these teams, the State of Goa

                acted in violation of the grant of mining leases policy and renewing the mining

                leases. A question was posed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as to why was

                the report from the Special Investigating Team not awaited or called for and

                examined. The Court pointed out that unfortunately, the undue haste in which

                the State acted gives the impression that it was willing to sacrifice the rule of

                law for the benefit of the mining lease holders and the explanation of

                satisfying the needs of some section of the society for their livelihood (after

                keeping them in the lurch for more than two years) was a mere fig leaf. The

                real intention of the second renewal was to satisfy avariciousness of mining

                lease holders, who were motivated by profits to be made through exploitation

                of natural resources. It was further pointed out that the undue haste in which

                the State granted the second renewal of mining lease particularly after the

                amendments proposed to the MMRD Act, were placed before the public

                domain by the Government of India is a clear indication that the decision of

                the State was not based on relevant material and not necessarily triggered by

                the interest of mineral development. That the haste with which the State took

                its decision also needs to be understood in the background of the fact that the

                mining had been suspended by the State in September, 2012, i.e., more than

                two years prior to the grant of second renewal; the urgency suddenly exhibited

                by the State (Goa), therefore, seems to be make-belief and motivated rather

                than genuine. Explaining as to how the issues impacting the society are to be

                K.S.Puttaswamy (Retd.) vs. UoI &amp; Ors. [(2017) 10 SCC 1], has recognised the

                right to question, the right to scrutinise and the right to dissent. While on this

                issue, we need to emphasis that the citizen has a fundamental right to have

                clean and healthy environment and the doctrine of waiver can have no

                application in this regard.

                Mr.K.V.Viswanathan, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the respondent

                supports his case. It is submitted that TNPCB has stated that the show cause

                notice dated 14.02.2017 has come to a logical end. In response to the query as

                to why there was no reference to the petitioner in the said notice the TNPCB

                stated that copper slag was dumped in a patta land and when enquiry was

                made by the revenue officials, it was known that the patta land owner

                purchased the copper slag and dumped it in his land adjacent to the odai and

                hence notice was given only to the patta land owner. Similarly other portions

                of the reply were read out and it was submitted that at no point of time

                TNPCB held the petitioner responsible for the dumping of the slag.

                the counsel and this cannot be relied upon by the petitioner and inadvertently

                the same was annexed in the paper book filed before the Hon'ble Supreme

                Court and the petitioner cannot take advantage of the same.               Firstly, we

                express out displeasure in the petitioner referring to the said document inspite

                of the fact that the respondent has taken a stand that it was inadvertently

                annexed in the paper book filed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. That apart

                the petitioner can stand in a no better footing by placing reliance on the said

                document. It is an un-signed note, not clear as to who prepared the reply.

                Secondly the petitioner had hoodwinked the revenue officials by stating that

                they have sold the slag and they are not responsible. Unfortunately, the

                revenue officials did not probe into the matter, did not read the conditions of

                the MOU, did not have a thorough discussion with the top officials of the

                TNPCB and we can safely conclude that they have colluded with the petitioner

                by not even issuing a show cause notice to the petitioner while issuing notice

                to Leelavathi. Therefore, nothing falls out of the reply given by the TNPCB to
