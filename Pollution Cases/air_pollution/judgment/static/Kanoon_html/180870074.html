</p><p id="p_4">     2. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that serious

nuisance and health hazards are caused due to air pollution on

account of emission of waste water from the vehicles carrying fish

through the National Highway-17 passing through Kasaragod,

Kannur and Kozhikode districts resulting in constant foul odour

and health hazards. Grounds 'B' and 'C' of the Writ Petition clearly

indicate what exactly is the emission which causes air pollution

and what enactment has to be looked into. For the sake of

convenience, the above two paragraphs are extracted hereunder:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                  "B. According to the studies conducted by

            US Department of Health, Education and

            Welfare,    the   presence    in  the    outdoor

            atmosphere of one or more contaminants or

            combinations thereof in such quantities and of

            such duration as may be or may tend to be

            injurious to human, plant or animal life or

            property or which unreasonably interferes with

            the comfortable enjoyment of life or property or

            conduct of business. An expert committee of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WP(C).24935/12                 3</span>

         the Central Pollution Control Board defined air

        pollution as contamination of surrounding air

        with unwanted odour, sound, gaseous or dust

        which tends to interference with comfortable

        living conditions. The 'WHO' has defined the air

        pollution as subsistence put into the air by the

        activity of man in concentration sufficient to

        cause harmful effect to the health, vegetation,

        property, or to interfere with the enjoyment of

        his property. Air pollution is presence in the

        outdoor    atmosphere       of    one    or  more

        contaminants such as dust, fumes, gas, mist,

        odour,    smoke      of   vapor     in   quantities

        characteristics and duration such as to be

        injurious to human, plants or animal life or

        property or which unreasonably interfere with

        the comfortable enjoyment of life and property.

        The    constant    spreading    of   waste   water

        throughout the public road comes within the

        purview   of    air  pollution   and   hence   the

        authorities vested with the power to control

        pollution is duty bound to take action or

        preventing such activities by the transporters of

        fish through the road. The inaction on the

        authorities is thus liable to be interfered with by

        this Hon'ble Court.

        <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981 defines air

        'pollutant' as any solid, liquid or gaseous

        subsistence including noise present in the

        atmosphere in such concentration as may be or

        tend to be injurious to human beings or other

        living creatures or plants or property or

        environment and air pollution defines under

        <a href="/doc/48181492/" id="a_3">section 2(b)</a> as the presence in the atmosphere

        of any air pollutant. <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_4">Section 17</a> of the Act

        enumerates the functions of the State Pollution

        Control    Board.   It   includes    to   plan   a

        comprehensive     programme       for  prevention

        control or abatement of air pollution and to

        secure the execution thereof and the Board is

        empowered     under    <a href="/doc/172134797/" id="a_5">section    22A</a>  to   make

        application to court for restraining persons from

        causing air pollution. In the case on hand, the

        emission of waste water from the lorries

        transporting fish causes severe air pollution

        resulting in serious health hazard. Hence the

        duty of the State Pollution Control Board to see

        that the nuisance caused by odour is abated.

        The failure on the part of the State Pollution

        Control Board is thus absolutely illegal, arbitrary

        and liable to be interfered with by this Hon'ble

        Court."
