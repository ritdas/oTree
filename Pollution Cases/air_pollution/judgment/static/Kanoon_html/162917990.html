</p>

<p id="p_16">   Submission on behalf of the Petitioner:
</p><p id="p_17">4. It is argued by the learned Senior Advocate for the Petitioner that

   the order passed by Respondent No.2 declaring the land as the
   government padtar land or gauchar land is manifestly illegal,
   invalid and ab initio void. That Respondent No.2 has not acted in
   consonance with the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and
   the High Court which are binding to the Respondent No.2. He
   submitted that the State is bound to notify all the water bodies

which vest in the government in the official gazette and the same
are required to be protected, maintained and preserved as per the
development plans, town planning schemes and the government
records. That such pond and are not be alienated or transferred and
shall not be utilized for any other purpose than the water bodies. It
is submitted that it is the bounden duty of the Respondent No.2 to
get the standard of quality of water of the water bodies as
prescribed by the concerned authorities under the law and device
the mechanism of periodic monitoring of the quality of water in
such water bodies.
</p>

<p id="p_18">4.1     Learned Senior Advocate for the petitioner has submitted
that the natural resources can only be used for public purpose and
its use cannot be transferred or converted into private ownership.
In support of this contention he has referred to and relied upon the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_1">M.C. Mehta v.
Kamal Nath</a> reported in (1997) 1 SCC 388.
</p>

<p id="p_19">4.2     Learned Senior Advocate for the petitioner has further
referred to and relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex court
in case of <a href="/doc/605100/" id="a_2">Chigurupati Venkata Subbayya v. Paladuge Anjayya</a>,
reported in (1972) 1 SCC 521 (529) and submitted that that the suit
lands in view of Section 3 of the Estates Abolition Act if vest in the
government, that by itself does not mean that the rights of the
community over can be taken away.         He therefore submitted that
the action of the Respondent No.2 is against the observations made

  invited the court's attention to the guidelines mentioned by this
  court in Special Civil Application No. 10621 of 2000 dated
  2.8.2000 with respect to notify all the lakes and ponds as may have
  been shown in the areas covered by the town planning schemes and
  the development plans as also those areas not so covered
  throughout the State, in the official gazette within three months
  from the date of the order passed the SCA 10621/2000 and also to

  has further referred to some other guidelines referred to in
  paragraph 24 (A) to 24 (G) of the SCA 10621/2000 by this court.
</p>

<p id="p_21">  4.4     The learned Senior Advocate of the petitioner therefore
  submitted that the order of the Respondents is erroneous, illgal and
  bad in the eye law and the present petitioner therefore deserves to
  be allowed and the order passed by the Respondent No.3 - The
  Collector, Navsari deserves to be quashed and set aside along with
  the Circulars dated 4.9.2012 and 21.5.2013 at Annexure-A and
  Annexure-B respectively and requested to allot the petition with
  cost.
</p>

<p id="p_22">  Submission on behalf of the Respondent No. 1 to 4:
</p><p id="p_23">5. Learned AGP Shri Sharma has argued that none of the fundamental
  rights or the of the legal rights of the petitioners have been violated
  because of any action or inaction on part of the present
  Respondent. That the land in question is not falling under the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                             Page 6 of 24</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                   Downloaded on : Mon Nov 25 22:24:32 IST 2019</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">   C/WPPIL/253/2015                                        CAV JUDGMENT</span>



  notified water bodies. Therefore the contention of the petitioner as
  regards to protect the land of the pond on Survey No. 405 is
  required to be rejected. It is further argued that the revenue land in
  question for the year 1967 shows that the land was given to the
  gram panchayat for the purpose of of pond without any
  compensation. That the allotment of order clearly contemplates
  that whenever the State Government requires parcel of land for any
  public purpose the same should be made available to the
  Government without any compensation.
</p>

<p id="p_24">  5.1     That on the land in question at present no pond was ever
  created over said site till 2016.          That the revenue records are
  submitted to that effect. That the petitioner is motivated on behalf
  of someone who has affected to the public purpose. That the
  Petition is not maintainable in law and the same deserves to be
  dismissed in limine.               That the Collector has received
  representation dated 2.1.2016 wherein the villagers have requested
  the Collector to see to it that the sub station is installed, is made
  functional at the earliest.        That the gram panchayat vide its
  Resolution dated 10.10.2012 consented to give the land in question
  for installation of sub station.
</p>

<p id="p_25">  5.2     It is also argued that the panchnama of the site was prepared
  which shows that the parcel of land is levelled as same level to the
  nearby land. Therefore it is requested to dismiss the writ petition
  with costs.

State Government.

<p id="p_29">6.1     Further it is stated that the proposal of the Respondent No.5

proposed land is suitable for the sub station. That the government
has handed over the possession of the land to GETCO on
10.9.2015.         That the amount of Rs.6,38,324/- was paid by the
GETCO to the government.                     That considering the various
parameters there is no other land better suitable for the sub station.
</p>

<p id="p_31">6.2     It is further argued that the petitioner is motivated in order to
either exert pressure on the various authorities so as to get the land
allotted to the GETCO at Survey No. 405 or to lead GETCO to
succumb to some illegal demand. That the petitioner is one of the
office bearer of Kameshwar Mahadev Mandir Trust. That the said
temple trust has addressed the communication dated 13.10.2013
giving consent for allotting the land to the GETCO for construction
and erection of sub station since the same was in the interest of the
village and the surrounding area. That the trust has also consented
to the Sarpanch and to the Talati-cum-Mantri of the Gadat Gram
Panchayat for consideration and erection of the sub station with
some conditions. That the trust has incurred cost for development
of tourism on the said land which is required to be returned. That
the petitioner is motivated to approach before the Hon'ble High
Court by way of present petition for not good cause. That the
petitioner being office bearer of the said trust wants to develop the
temple and the lake around the temple. That the petitioner is the
Treasurer of the said trust. Therefore the petitioner is interested

</p><p id="p_33">7. This court has come across the judgment in case of <a href="/doc/1368956/" id="a_3">Kushum Lata
  v. Union of India &amp; ors</a>. reported in AIR 2006 SC 2643 wherein
  the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                     "5. When there is material to show that a petition
                     styled as a public interest litigation is nothing but a
                     camouflage to foster personal disputes, said petition is
                     to be thrown out. Before we grapple with the issue
                     involved in the present case, we feel it necessary to
                     consider the issue regarding public interest aspect.
                     Public Interest Litigation which has now come to
                     occupy an important field in the administration of law
                     should not be "publicity interest litigation" or "private
                     interest litigation" or "politics interest litigation" or
                     the latest trend "paise income litigation .... If not
                     properly regulated and abuse averted, it becomes also
                     a tool in unscrupulous hands to release vendetta and
                     wreck vengeance, as well. There must be real and
                     genuine public interest involved in the litigation and
                     not merely an adventure of knight errant borne out of
                     wishful thinking. It cannot also be invoked by a person
                     or a body of persons to further his or their personal
                     causes or satisfy his or their personal grudge and
                     enmity. Courts of justice should not be allowed to be
                     polluted by unscrupulous litigants by resorting to the
                     extraordinary jurisdiction. A person acting bona fide
                     and having sufficient interest in the proceeding of
                     public interest litigation will alone have a locus standi
                     and can approach the Court to wipe out violation of
                     fundamental rights and genuine infraction of statutory
                     provisions, but not for personal gain or private profit
                     or political motive or any oblique consideration.

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                   13. Public interest litigation is a weapon which has
                   to be used with great care and circumspection and the
                   judiciary has to be extremely careful to see that
                   behind the beautiful veil of public interest an ugly
                   private malice, vested interest and/or publicity seeking
                   is not lurking. It is to be used as an effective weapon
                   in the armory of law for delivering social justice to the
                   citizens. The attractive brand name of public interest
                   litigation should not be used for suspicious products
                   of mischief. It should be aimed at redressal of genuine
                   public wrong or public injury and not publicity
                   oriented or founded on personal vendetta. As
                   indicated above, Court must be careful to see that a
                   body of persons or member of public, who approaches
                   the court is acting bona fide and not for personal gain
                   or private motive or political motivation or other
                   oblique considerations. The Court must not allow its
                   process to be abused for oblique considerations by
                   masked phantoms who monitor at times from behind.

   land allotted to the GETCO is equal to the level of the land of the
   surrounding area. There is no possibility of collection of water on
   the land allotted to the GETCO - Respondent No.5. Considering
   the object of the allotment of the land it appears that it is not for a
   personal cause but is for the benefit of the people of the village of
   the Gadat and the surrounding villages. Thus, we conclude that
   the Appellant has failed to establish that the land allotted to the
   GETCO - Respondent No.5 is against the public purpose.
