</blockquote><p id="p_72">57.                The present suit is filed by the plaintiff seeking a decree of
mandatory injunction for the removal of cellular tower affixed by the
defendant no. 1 to 3. From the deliberations in the previous issues it is
established that plaintiff has raised unauthorised construction which
was even booked by MCD for demolishing the same. The testimony of
DW-2 Shri G.S. Yadav, Asstt. Engineer Building clearly reflects that no
commission was taken by the MCD for installation of the cellular tower
by the MCD. It is also deposed that as per the official record authorized

 construction in the shape of errection of cellular tower, steel structure
was booked by the department for unauthorized construction dated
24.11.2003 vide file no. 180/B/UC/ CLZ/2003. It is also stated on oath
that either due to shortage of time or diversion of forces to the other
premises the action against the abovesaid illegal construction could not
be taken.         He further depose that as per the official record, the
demolition action was taken on 10.12.2009 whereby roof at the 4th floor
was demolished but the cellular tower is still in existence and that has
not been removed by the MCD.
