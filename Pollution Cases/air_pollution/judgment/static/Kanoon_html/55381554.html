of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification dated 14.9.2006

issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the directions

</p><p id="p_3">3.    The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) vide Notification

dated 14th September, 2006 issued under sub-rule (3) of Rule 5 of the

Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 and sub-section (1) and clause (v) of

sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_2">Section 3</a> of the Environment (protection) Act, 1986, in

supersession of its earlier Notification dated 27th January, 1994, except in

respect of things done or omitted to be done before such supersession,

directed that        on and from the date of its publication the required

construction    of    new   projects   or   activities   or   the   expansion   or

modernization of existing projects or activities listed in the Schedule to

the Notification, entailing capacity addition with change in process and or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>

technology, shall be undertaken in any part of India, only after the prior

environmental clearance from the Central Government or as the case may

be, by the     State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority

(SLEIAA) constituted by the Central Government under sub-section (3) of

<a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_3">section 3</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, in accordance with

the procedure specified in the Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    The clause-4 of the Notification dated 14th September, 2006

categorized the projects and activities in Category-A and Category-B,

based on the spatial extent of potential impacts on human health and

natural and man made resources. Whereas the projects and activities

included in Category-A of the Schedule, including expansion and

modernization of existing projects or activities and change in product mix,

shall require prior environmental clearance from the Central Government

in the MoEF, on the recommendations of an Expert Appraisal Committee

(EAC) constituted by the Central government, all projects or activities

included in Category-B of the Schedule, including expansion and

modernization of existing projects or activities as specified in sub-

paragraph (ii) of paragraph 2, or change in product mix as specified in sub-

paragraph (iii) of paragraph 2, but excluding those which fulfill the

General Conditions (GC) stipulated in the Schedule, will require prior

environmental clearance from the State/Union territory Environment

Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA). The SEIAA was required to base its

decision on the recommendations of a State or Union territory level Expert

Appraisal Committee (SEAC), to be constituted under the Notification.

</p><p id="p_5">5.    For the present, we are concerned with the mining of minerals,

which falls in Category-A of the Schedule and which includes mining,

extraction of natural resources and power generation (for a specified

production capacity). In the project or activity, in column no.(2), the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      4</span>

mining of minerals is included and which includes in column no.(3) the

mining lease area of more than 50 hectares and in column no.(4), less than

50 hectare, which also includes the mining lease area of more than 5

hectares. In column no.(5), it is provided that the General Conditions shall

apply, except in the Note "mineral prospecting (not involving drilling) are

exempted provided the construction areas have got previous clearance for

physical survey".
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.    The Notification provides for screening, scoping and appraisal in

clause-5 by the Expert Appraisal Committees (EACs) and the State Expert

Appraisal Committees (SEACs) for Category-A and Category-B projects

respectively. The EACs and SEACs were required to meet atleast once

every month, to be re-constituted after every three years. The clause-6

provided for application for prior Environmental Clearance (EC) and

clause-7 provided for stages in the prior EC process for new projects.

Clause 7(i) provided for four stages for environmental clearance process,

which includes screening only for Category-B projects and activities, in

stage(1); scoping in stage (2); public consultation in      stage (3); and

appraisal in stage (4).
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.    The "screening" in stage (1) is provided to be made by the

concerned SEAC as to whether or not the project or activity requires

further environmental studies for preparation of EIA for its appraisal,

depending upon the nature and location specificity of the project, to be

put in Category-B1 for EIA and remaining projects in Category-B2.

</p><p id="p_8">8.    The "scoping" in stage (2) refers to the process by which the Expert

Appraisal Committee in the case of Category-A projects or activities

including the applications for expansion and/or modernization and/or

change in product mix, is required to            determine detailed and

comprehensive Terms of Reference (TOR)            addressing all relevant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                          5</span>

environmental concerns for the preparation of EIA, after a site visit by a

sub-group of EAC or SEAC, except all projects and activities listed in

Category-B       of        Item-8   of       the   Schedule,   which   included

construction/township/commercial complexes/houses.

</p><p id="p_9">9.    The "public consultation" in stage (3) refers to the process, by

which the concerns of local affected persons and others, who have

plausible stake in the environmental impacts of the project or activity are

to be ascertained with a view of taking into account all the material

concerns in the project or activity design as appropriate. All projects in

Category-A and Category-B1 require public consultation to be conducted

by the State Pollution Control Board or the Union territory Pollution

Control Committee, which will forward the proceedings to the regulatory

authority within 45 days. A public hearing is required to be made at the

site or in close proximity, after obtaining responses in writing from other

concerned persons having a plausible stake in the environmental aspects of

the project or activity.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.   The 'appraisal" in stage (4) in the Notification means the detailed

scrutiny by the EAC or SLEAC on the applications and other documents like

the final EIA report, outcome of the public consultations including public

hearing proceedings to be made by EAC or SLEAC in a transparent manner.

On conclusion, categorical recommendations are required to be made by

the EAC or SLEAC to the regulatory authority for grant of prior

environmental clearance on stipulated terms and conditions, or rejection

of the application together with reasons for the same.

</p><p id="p_11">11.   Clause-9 of the Notification provided for validity of environmental

clearance    for a period of ten years in case of         river valley projects,

subject to maximum of thirty years for mining projects and five years in

the case of all other projects and activities. The Notification also provides
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      6</span>

in clause-10 for environmental clearance monitoring, and in clause-11 for

transferability of environmental clearance to any other legal person, on

an application for transfer with "no objection" of transferor, by the

regulatory authority concerned, without any reference to the EAC or

SLEAC.
</p>
<p id="p_12">12.   In the earlier D.B.Writ (PIL) Petition No.10304/2010 filed by the

petitioner, the facts were that the Government of Rajasthan issued an

advertisement dated 4.3.2009 inviting applications for quarry licenses for

mining of sand-stones mineral in the Sihanda area of Tehsil Baleswar,

District Jodhpur, proposing to allot huge area for undertaking mining

activities to the individuals. The Department of Mines had taken a decision

for undertaking mining on a land measuring 201.06 hectares, for which a

mandatory environmental clearance was required from MoEF under the

Notification dated 14.9.2006. The Mining Department without taking any

environmental clearance started the process of allotment, which was

challenged by the petitioner, with the prayer to restrain the allotment of

quarry licenses for mining activities in Sihanda area in District Jodhpur, in

pursuance to the advertisement dated 4.3.2009 without obtaining

Environmental Clearance (EC) and to quash the advertisement dated

4.3.2009. The writ petition was allowed by the Division Bench of this Court

vide order dated 19.8.2011, with the opinion that as the area in question is

201.06 hectares, in which     cluster of mines are to be allotted and for

which the     total number of mines are 1117, the mining activity is

obviously for an area of more than 50 hectares of land and as such, the

activity would fall within the Category-A of EIA Notification dated

14.9.2006. When the total area, upon which the mining activities are to be

undertaken, is 201.06 hectares, dividing it into small pieces will not make

it mining activities in less than 50 hectares. The Court observed that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      7</span>

mining activities above 50 hectares are bound to have impact upon

environment, flora and fauna in the area. The development has to be

sustainable. The Court further observed that the man must live in harmony

with nature. With a view to protect the forest wealth and wildlife of the

areas, the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953 was         enacted. In order to check

deforestation, which ultimately results in ecological imbalance and leads

to environmental degradation, the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_4">Forest Conservation Act</a>, 1980 was

enacted. '<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_5">The Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 was enacted with a view

to provide for the protection and improvement of environment and for

matters connected therewith. Under Rule 5(3) of the              Environment

(Protection) Rules, 1986, the EIA Notification dated 14.9.2006 was issued.

The ecological imbalances and consequent environmental damage which

has become alarming due to reckless mining operations for which there is

urgent need for preservation of forests, flora and fauna and to preserve

the forests. After referring to the decisions of the Supreme Court in Tarun

Bharat Sangh, Alwar V/s Union of India &amp; Ors. (1992 Supp.(2) SCC 448),

T.N.Godavarman Thirumulpad V/s Union of India &amp; Ors. ((2002) 10 SCC

</p><p id="p_13">606), M.C.Mehta V/s Union of India &amp; Ors. ((1992) Supp.2 SCC 85), Satish

V/s State of Uttar Pradesh (1992 Supp.(2) SCC 94), T.N.Godavarman

Thirumulpad (104) V/s Union of India &amp; Ors. ((2008) 2 SCC 222) and

T.N.Godavarman Thirumulpad (104) V/s Union of India &amp; Ors. ((2009) 6

SCC 142) and the principles of sustainable development, based on inter-

generational equity, the Court held that no allotment of mines is

permissible until and unless prior environmental clearance is obtained. The

concluding paragraphs of the judgment are quoted as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "In the cases of mining lease, requiring clearance as per EIA
      Notification of 2006, we are of the considered opinion that no
      allotment   of   mines   is   permissible    until   and   unless   prior
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   8</span>

environmental clearance is obtained, any action to the contrary is
per se illegal. The EIA Notification dated 14.9.2006 is mandatory
and is having statutory force issued under Rule 5(3) of the Rules of
1986. In case, mining area is permitted to be allotted and
possession is permitted to be handed over before clearance is
granted, whole purpose of EIA Notification would be defeated. The
duty of the courts is to ensure that such an interpretation is not
adopted, which would frustrate very purpose of obtaining the
requisite clearance. The illegal mining has become a menace. Even
otherwise, mining activity has to be sustainable, to ensure it the
said notification of EAI of 2006 has been issued. In case, allotment
of mines is permitted before clearance, it would be extremely
difficult and impossible to further check the illegal mining and
whole purpose of the EIA Notification of 2006 would be frustrated

<p id="p_18">13.    In a land mark case concerning the mining activities, considering the

concern in which the Department of Mines and Geology, Government of

Haryana had issued auction notice dated 3.6.2011 proposing to auction the

extraction of minor mineral boulder, gravel and sand quarries of an area

not exceeding 4.5. hectares in the District of Panchkula and the auction

notice dated 8.8.2011 in the Districts of Panchkula, Ambala and Yamuna

Nagar exceeding 5 hectares and above, as well as other areas in the

Districts of Kurukshetra, Karnal, Faridabad and Palwal for quarrying in the

river beds of Yamuna, Tangri, Markanda, Ghaggar, Krishnavati River basin,

Dohar River basic etc., as well as the complaints of illegal mining going on

in the State of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

IA Nos.12-13 of 2011 in Special Leave petition (C) No.19628-19629 of 2009

Deepak Kumar etc. V/s State of Haryana and Others etc. passed an order

on 27th February, 2012 for effective compliance of the Notification dated

14.9.2006 issued by the MoEF. The Supreme Court expressed its concern

on the illegal mining in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the order as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "8. We are expressing our deep concern since we are faced with a
      situation where the auction notices dated 3.6.2011 and 8.8.2011 have
      permitted quarrying mining and removal of sand from in-stream and
      upstream of several rivers, which may have serious environmental
      impact on ephemeral, seasonal and perennial rivers and river beds
      and sand extraction may have an adverse effect on bio-diversity as
      well. Further it may also lead to bed degradation and sedimentation
      having a negative effect on the aquatic life. Rivers mentioned in the
      auction notices are on the foothills of the fragile Shivalik hills.</blockquote><p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">      Shivalik hills are the source of rivers like Ghaggar, Tangri, Markanda
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                10</span>

etc. River Ghaggar is a seasonal river which rises up in the outer
Himalayas between Yamuna and Satluj and enters Haryana near
Pinjore, District Panchkula, which passes through Ambala and Hissar
and reaches Bikaner in Rajasthan. River Markanda is also a seasonal
river like Ghaggar, which also originates from the lower Shivalik hills
and enters Haryana near Ambala. During monsoon, this stream swells
up into a raging torrent, notorious for its devastating power, as also,
river Yamuna.
</p><p id="p_21">9. We find that it is without conducting any study on the possible
environmental impact on/in the river beds and else where the
auction notices have been issued. We are of the considered view that
when we are faced with a situation where extraction of alluvial
material within or near a river bed has an impact on the rivers
physical habitat characteristics, like river stability, flood risk,
environmental degradation, loss of habitat, decline in biodiversity, it
is not an answer to say that the extraction is in blocks of less than 5
hectares, separated by 1 kilometre, because their collective impact
may be significant, hence the necessity of a proper environmental
assessment plan. Possibly this may be the reason that in the affidavit
filed by the MoEF on 23.11.2011 along with the annexure-2 report,
the following stand has been taken:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      "The Ministry is of the opinion that where the mining area is
      homogenous, physically proximate end on identifiable piece of
      land of 5 ha or more, it should not be broken into smaller sizes
      to circumvent the EIA Notification, 2006 as the EIA
      Notification, 2006 is not applicable to the mining projects
      having lease area of less than 5 ha. The Report of Committee
      on Minor Minerals, under the Chairmanship of the Secretary
      (E&amp;F) with representatives of various state Governments as
      members including the State of Haryana and Rajasthan
      recommended a minimum lease size of 5 ha for minor minerals
      for undertaking scientific mining for the purpose of integrating
      and addressing environmental concerns. Only in cases of
      isolated discontinued mineral deposits in less than 5 ha, such
      mining leases may be considered keeping in view the mineral
      conservation."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_22">Situations referred to earlier prevail not only in the State of Haryana
but also in the neighbouring and other States of the country as well
and those issues had come up for serious deliberations before the
Government of India, on various occasions."

</p><p id="p_24">14.   The Supreme Court noticed in paragraph-10 of the order that the

Notification of MoEF of the year 1994 did not apply to the mining of minor

minerals and noticing that minor minerals were brought under the ambit of

EIA Notification of 2006 and as per the said Notification mining of minerals

with a lease area of 5 hectares and above require prior environmental

clearance, it observed that the MoEF's attention was drawn to several

instances across the country damaging lakes, riverbeds and groundwater

leading to drying up of water beds and causing water scarcity on account

of quarry/mining leases and mineral concessions granted by the State

Governments, even if the area was small, the collective impact on

environment was significant. The Supreme Court mentioned that MoEF

constituted a Core Group under the chairmanship of the Secretary (E&amp;F)

vide its order dated 24.3.2009. The Group held its meeting and discussed

the impact that may be caused by quarrying/mining of minor minerals on

riverbeds and ground waters. It was noticed by the Group that individual

mines of minor minerals being small in size may have insignificant impact,

however, their collective impact, taking into consideration various mines

on a regional scale, is significantly adverse and thus,         appropriate

guidelines were required to be issued. The issues, which were brought up

for consideration, were as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "(i) the need to re-look the definition of minor mineral, (ii)
      minimum size of lease for adopting eco-friendly scientific mining
      practices, (iii) period of lease, (iv) cluster of mine approach for
      addressing and implementing EMP in case of small mines, (v) depth
      of mining to minimize adverse impact on hydrological regime, (vi)
      requirement of mine plan for minor minerals, similar to major
      minerals, and (vii) reclamation of mined out area, post mine land
      use, progressive mine closure plan etc."

<p id="p_25">15.   Based on the discussion and subsequent conclusions, a draft report

was prepared, which was further discussed on 29.1.2010 for its

finalization. The issues and the recommendations, which are relevant for

the purposes of this case in paragraphs 4.2 to 4.8 are quoted below:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "4.2 Size of the Mine Lease:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                    Area for grant of mine lease varies from State to State.
      Maximum area which can be held under one or more mine lease is
      2590 ha or 25.90 sq.miles in Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Rajasthan prescribed
      a minimum limit of 1 ha for a lease. Maximum area prescribed for
      permit is 50x50 m. In most of the States area of permit is not
      specified in the rules. It has recently been observed by Punjab and
      Haryana High Court in its order dated 15.5.2009 that State
      Government are apparently granting short term permits by dividing
      the mining area into small zones in effect avoids environmental
      norms.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                  There is, thus a need to bring uniformity in the extent
      of area to be granted for mine lease so as to ensure that eco
      friendly scientific mining practices can be adopted. It is
      recommended that the minimum size of mine lease should be 5
      ha. Further, preparation of comprehensive mine plan for
      contiguous stretches of mineral deposits by the respective State
      Governments may also be encouraged. This may suitably be
      incorporated in the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 by Ministry of
      Mines.
</blockquote>


<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      4.3 Period of Mine Lease:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                    The period of lease varies from State to State
      depending on type of concessions, minerals and its end use. The
      minimum lease period is one year and maximum 30 years. Minerals
      like granite where huge investments are required, a period of 20
      years is generally given with the provisions of renewal. Permits are
      generally granting for short periods which vary from one month to a
      maximum one year. In States like Haryana, minor mineral leases are
      auctioned for a particular time period. Mining is considered to be
      capital intensive industry and considerable time is lost for
      developing the mine before it attains the status of fully developed
      mine. If the tenure of the mine lease is short, it would encourage
      the lessee to concentrate more on rapid exploitation of mineral
      without really undertaking adequate measures for reclamation and
      rehabilitation of mined out area, posing thereby a serious threat to
      the environment and health of the workers and public at large.</blockquote><p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">                     There is thus, a need to bring uniformity in the period
      of lease. It is recommended that a minimum period of mine lease
      should be 5 years, so that eco friendly scientific and sustainable
      mining practices are adopted. However, under exceptional
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                              13</span>

circumstances arising due to judicial interventions, short term
mining leases / contracts could be granted to the State Agencies
to meet the situation arising there from.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
4.4 Cluster of Mine Approach for Small Sized Mines:
</p><p id="p_29">             Considering the nature of occurrence of minor mineral,
economic condition of the lessee and the likely difficulties to be
faced by Regulatory Authorities in monitoring the environmental
impacts and implementation of necessary mitigation measures, it
may be desirable to adopt cluster approach in case of smaller
mine leases being operated presently. Further, these clusters
need be provided with processing/crusher zones for forward
integration and minimizing excessive pressure on road
infrastructure. The respective State Governments / Mine Owners
Associations may facilitate implementation of Environment
Management Plans in such cluster of mines.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
4.5 Requirement of Mine Plan for Minor Minerals:
</p><p id="p_31">            At present, most of the State Governments have not
made it mandatory for preparation of mining plan in respect of
minor minerals. In some States like Rajasthan, eco friendly mining
plans are prepared, which are approved by the State Mining
Department. The eco friendly mining plans so prepared, though
conceptually welcome, are observed to be deficient and need to be
made comprehensive in a manner as is being done for major
minerals. Besides, the aspects of reclamation and rehabilitation of
mined out areas, progressive mine closure plan, as in vogue for
major minerals could be introduced for minor minerals as well.
</p><p id="p_32">             It is recommended that provision for preparation and
approval of mine plan, as in the case of major minerals may
appropriately be provided in the Rules governing the mining of
minor minerals by the respective State Governments. These
should specifically include the provision for reclamation and
rehabilitation of mined out area, progressive mine closure plan
and post mine land use.
</p>
<p id="p_33">
4.6 Creation of Separate Corpus for Reclamation / Rehabilitation
of Mines of Minor Minerals:
</p><p id="p_34">             Mining of minor minerals, in our country, is by and
large unorganized sector and is practiced in haphazard and
unscientific manner. At times, the size of the leasehold is also too
small to address the issue of reclamation and rehabilitation of
mined outs areas. It may, therefore, be desirable that before the
concept of mine closure plan for minor minerals is adopted, the
existing abandoned mines may be reclaimed and rehabilitated with
the involvement of the State Government. There is thus, a need to
create a separate corpus, which may be utilized for reclamation
and rehabilitation of mined out areas. The respective State
Governments may work out a suitable mechanism for creation of
such corpus on the `polluter pays' principle. An organizational
structure may also need to be created for undertaking and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                      14</span>

      monitoring these activities.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
      4.7 Depth of Mining:
</p><p id="p_36">                   Mining of minerals, whether major or minor have a
      direct bearing on the hydrological regime of the area. Besides,
      affecting the availability of water as a resource, it also affects the
      quality of water through direct run of going into the surface water
      bodies and infiltration / leaching into groundwater. Further,
      groundwater withdrawal, dewatering of water from mine pit and
      diversion of surface water may cause surface and sub surface
      hydrologic systems to dry up. An ideal situation would require that
      quarrying should be restricted to unsaturated zone only above the
      phreatic water table and should not intersect the groundwater table
      at any point of time. However, from the point of view of mineral
      conservation, it may not be desirable to impose blanket ban on
      mining operation below groundwater table.
</p><p id="p_37">                   It is, therefore, recommended that detailed hydro-
      geological report should be prepared in respect of any mining
      operation for minor minerals to be undertaken below
      groundwater table. Based on the findings of the study so
      undertaken and the comments / recommendations of Central
      Ground Water Authority / State Ground Water Board, a decision
      regarding restriction on depth of mining for any area should be
      taken on case to case basis.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
      4.8 Uniform Minor Mineral Concession Rules:
</p><p id="p_39">                   The economic value of the minor minerals excavated in
      the country is estimated to contribute to about 9% of the total value
      of the minerals whereas the non metallic minerals contribute to
      about 2.8%. Keeping in view the large extent of mining of minor
      minerals and its significant potential to adversely affect the
      environment, it is recommended that Model Mineral Concession
      rules may be framed for minor minerals as well and the minor
      minerals may be subjected to a simpler regulatory regime, which
      is, however, similar to major minerals regime."
</p>
<p id="p_40">
The Committee concluded in paragraph 5 as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      "5.0 Conclusion:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">      Mining of minor minerals, though individually, because of smaller
      size of mine leases is perceived to have lesser impact as compared
      to mining of major minerals.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">            However, the activity as a whole is seen to have significant
            adverse impacts on environment. It is, therefore, necessary
            that the mining of minor minerals is subjected to simpler but
            strict regulatory regime and carried out only under an
            approved framework of mining plan, which should provide for
            reclamation and rehabilitation of the mined out areas.
            Further, while granting mining leases by the respective State
            Governments "location of any eco-fragile zone(s) within the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                     15</span>

            impact zone of the proposed mining area, the linked
            Rules/Notifications governing such zones and the judicial
            pronouncements, if any, need be duly noted. The Union
            Ministry of Mines along with Indian Bureau of Mines and
            respective State Governments should therefore make
            necessary provisions in this regard under the Mines and
            Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_7">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957, Mineral
            Concession Rules, 1960 and adopt model guidelines to be
            followed by all States. " (emphasis supplied)


      The report clearly indicates that operation of mines of minor
      minerals needs to be subjected to strict regulatory parameters as
      that of mines of major minerals. It was also felt necessary to have a
      re-look to the definition of "minor" minerals per se. The necessity of
      the preparation of "comprehensive mines plan" for contiguous
      stretches of mineral deposits by the respective State Governments
      may also be encouraged and the same be suitably incorporated in
      the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 by the Ministry of Mines. Further,
      it was also recommended that States, Union Territories would see
      that mining of minor minerals is subjected to simpler but strict
      regulatory regime and carried out only under an approved
      framework of mining plan, which should provide for reclamation and
      rehabilitation of mined out areas. Mining Plan should take note of
      the level of production, level of mechanisation, type of machinery
      used in the mining       of minor    minerals, quantity       of diesel
      consumption, number of trees uprooted, export and import of
      mining minerals, environmental impact, restoration of flora and host
      of other matters referred to in 2010 rules. A proper framework has
      also to be evolved on cluster of mining of minor mineral for which
      there must be a Regional Environmental Management Plan. Another
      important decision taken was that while granting of mining leases by
      the respective State Governments, location of any eco-fragile zone
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">      (s) within the impact zone of the proposed mining area, the linked
      Rules/Notifications   governing    such   zones   and   the     judicial
      pronouncements, if any, need to be duly noted."</blockquote><p id="p_41">

<p id="p_44">18.      The Supreme Court observed in paragraph-14 of the order dated

27.2.2012 that all State Governments/Union Territories have to give due

weight to the      recommendations of the MoEF, which are             made in

consultation with all the State Governments and Union Territories. The

Model Rules of 2010 issued by the Ministry of Mines are very vital from the

environmental, ecological and bio-diversity point of view and therefore,

the State Governments have to frame proper Rules in accordance with the

recommendations      under   <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_11">section    15</a>   of   the   Mines   and   Minerals

(Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_12">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957. The Supreme Court, thereafter,

in paragraphs 16 to 19 issued directions requiring the State of Haryana

and various other States to implement the recommendations of the

MoEF and the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Mines, before issuing

auction notices granting short term permits by way of auction of minor

mineral boulders, gravel, sand etc. in the river beds and elsewhere of

less than 5 hectares. The directions were issued to all the States, Union

Territories, MoEF and the Ministry of Mines to           give effect to the

recommendations made by the MoEF in its report of March, 2010 and

the Model Guidelines framed by the Ministry of Mines, within a period of

six months and submit compliance reports. In the meanwhile, the

Supreme Court ordered that leases of minor mineral including their

renewal for an area of less than five hectares be granted by the

States/Union Territories only after getting environmental clearance

have an effective framework of mining plan which will take care of
all environmental issues and also evolve a long term rational and
sustainable use of natural resource base and also the bio-assessment
protocol. Sand mining, it may be noted, may have an adverse effect
on bio-diversity as loss of habitat caused by sand mining will effect
various species, flora and fauna and it may also destabilize the soil
structure of river banks and often leaves isolated islands. We find
that, taking note of those technical, scientific and environmental
matters,   MoEF,    Government         of   India,   issued   26   various

clearance provided under the Notification of the MoEF dated 14th

September, 2006. All the 15 environmental safeguards provided under Rule

37T are conditions imposed upon the association, the implementation of

which is left at the discretion of the association.

<p id="p_100">25.     It is submitted that the cluster level environmental conditions under

Rule 37U are provided to be       incorporated in the EMP, which include

removal and utilization of top soil and storage of overburden waste rock,

reclamation and rehabilitation of lands, precaution against air pollution,

discharge of effluents, precaution against noise, restoration of flora, water

management,         corporate   social     responsibility   and   Environmental

eligibility criteria given in Appendix-VI to the Notification of MoEF dated

14.9.2006. One of the Members, who is an expert in the Environmental

Impact Assessment process shall be the Chairman of the SLEIAA. In the

offending Rules 37P to 37U, there is no provision of screening, scoping and

appraisal nor general public is involved in the EMP in any manner

whatsoever. The entrusting of responsibility to the concerned association

of cluster      for carrying out environment development work from

Environmental Management Fund, is in complete violation of the provisions

of the Notification of MoEF dated 14.9.2006, the recommendations of the

Core Group under the Chairmanship of the Secretary (E&amp;F) and the Model

Guidelines evolved by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India, on the

affidavit of the Principal Secretary, Department of Mines and Petroleum,

Government of Rajasthan, Jaipur, it may be found that after issuance of

Notification dated 19.6.2012, in purported compliance of the judgment of

the Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's case, upto 09.09.2013, when the

MoEF issued a fresh notification including the leases for the area less than

5 hectares and after which, only 14 mining leases have been granted after

obtaining environmental clearance from the State Level Environment

Impact Assessment Authority, as many as 444 mining leases, 86 quarry

licenses and 7874 short term permits were granted for the area less than 5

hectares and the existing quarry licenses were renewed without

Environmental Clearance.    It is submitted   that there are about 19,000

leases, which have been granted in the State of Rajasthan plundering the

mineral wealth of the State, without obtaining the Environmental

Clearance from the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority.

The State of Rajasthan has violated the environmental laws, in a brazen

attempt to degrade the environment in the State of Rajasthan and in open

defiance of the Notification issued by the MoEF and the directions of the

Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's case.
</p>
<p id="p_127">31.   It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that Rule 37G

(6) &amp; (7) provides for "deemed approval" of the mining plan or mining

scheme or the modified mining plan or scheme. If the competent authority

does not grant approval or disapproval within 90 days, the mining plan in

such case will be deemed to have been provisionally approved and such

approval shall be subject to the final decision. The State Government

under Rule 37G has reviewed as many as 672 deemed approvals, out of

which, on scrutiny, only 50 deemed approvals were rejected and that as

stated in para 4 of the affidavit of Shri Ashok Singhvi, Principal Secretary,

Department of Mines and Petroleum, Government of Rajasthan, Jaipur

between 19.6.2012 and 31.12.2014, 10478 mining plans/schemes were

approved. The Notification dated 19.6.2012 providing for rates of

Environmental Management Fund at Rs.15000/- per hectare has resulted in

accumulation of Rs.219 crores, out of which, not a single penny has been

spent for rehabilitation of the mining area.

<p id="p_129">33.   It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that the State

has played a fraud on the conditions of Notification issued by the MoEF

and the order passed in Deepak Kumar's case. The amended Rules have

been submitted before the Supreme Court alongwith an affidavit, which

have not been approved by the Supreme Court. The order in Deepak

Kumar's case did not authorize the State Government to proceed to grant

and renew mining leases without approval of the amended Rules and

which, in any case, are not likely to be approved, as these Rules have been

made in complete violation of the Notification of MoEF, Model Guidelines

issued by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India and the directions

issued in Deepak Kumar's case.

</p><p id="p_131">34.     Learned Additional Advocate General defending the amended Rules

submits that there was no restriction in the MoEF Notification of 1994, nor

there was any restriction prior to the order dated 27.2.2012 in Deepak

Kumar's case to grant mining leases for the area of less than 5 hectares

without obtaining the Environmental Clearance. The order dated 27.2.2012

passed in Deepak Kumar's case directed the State Government to make

Rules in consonance with the Notification of MoEF dated 14.9.2006, the

letter of the Ministry of Mines, Government of India dated           16.5.2011

called "Environmental aspects of quarrying of minor minerals- Evolving of

Model Guidelines", Model Rules of 2010 issued by the Ministry of Mines and

the directions issued in Deepak Kumar's case. The State Government was

directed to implement the recommendations of MoEF and the guidelines

issued by the Ministry of Mines before issuing lease/license/short term

permit for the area less than 5 hectares, within a period of six months and

to submit compliance report and in the meanwhile, the renewal of mining

leases for the area of less than 5 hectares to be granted by the State

Government/Union Territory was directed to be given after obtaining

Environmental Clearance from the MoEF. The State Government amended

the Rules by amending the definition of "cluster" and inserting Rules 37P

to 37U and has submitted the compliance affidavit in the Supreme Court.

The Rules amended by Notification dated 19.6.2012 have incorporated all

the recommendations of      MoEF    of March, 2010 as well as the Model

Guidelines of the Ministry of Mines, Government of India. In the directions

given    in   Deepak   Kumar's   case,    it   was   clear   that   the   State

Governments/Union Territories were directed to frame Rules as per the

recommendations of MoEF of March, 2010 and the Model Rules of 2010

issued by the Ministry of Mines. The State Government/Union Territories

can grant/renew the mining leases for the area less than 5 hectares in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                     39</span>

light of such Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_132">35.   The Additional Advocate General submits that Rule 37P to 37U fully

serve the requirements of Notification of MoEF and that of the Model Rules

of 2010 framed by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India and thus,

the grant of mining lease, quarry licenses and short term permits as well as

the renewal of the existing leases, do not suffer from violation of

directions issued in Deepak Kumar's case.
</p>
<p id="p_133">36.   It is further submitted by the Additional Advocate General that after

the Notification dated 9th September, 2013, by which the leases for less

than 5 hectares were also covered by the Notification of MoEF dated

14.9.2006 and of March, 2010, the State Government has not granted any

mining lease without obtaining Environmental Clearance. Only 14 mining

leases have been granted after 9.9.2013, after the Environmental

Clearance was given for such leases by the State Level Environment Impact

Assessment Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_134">37.   It is submitted by Additional Advocate General that 58 conditions

were imposed at the time of granting mining leases, quarry licenses and

short term permits on all the persons, who are required to be members of

the association of the cluster. These conditions fully served the

requirements of Notifications of MoEF and the Model Rules of 2010 framed

by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India, as well as the conditions

imposed in the order passed in Deepak Kumar's case.
</p>
<p id="p_135">38.   Learned    Additional   Advocate   General   submits   that   deeming

provision is applicable only in respect of renewal of the existing mining

leases/quarry licenses/short term permits, which are having area more

than one hectare in sub-rule (1) and having area upto one hectare under

sub-rule (2) of Rule 37G. The deeming provision is, however, provisional

and that after scrutiny, out of 672 deemed approvals, 50 deemed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                     40</span>

approvals were rejected and 622 were approved by the competent

authority. Rs.219 crores under Environmental Management Fund has been

recovered since its imposition in June, 2012 in the State. Since the terms

of leases have not been expired, the amount has not been spent so far.

</p><p id="p_136">39.   It is submitted that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) did not have

any authority to issue the directions dated 13th January, 2015 in respect of

mining leases and the non-compliance of the conditions of MoEF

Notifications, Model Guidelines of the Ministry of Mines, Government of

India and the directions in Deepak Kumar's case, for the State of

Rajasthan. The NGT has no jurisdiction to pass order to quash the

Notifications issued by the MoEF and the State of Rajasthan and to issue

directions for all mining leases to obtain the environmental clearance from

the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority beyond the

permissibility of the Rules, as amended by the State of Rajasthan by

Notification dated 19.6.2012. The State of Rajasthan has challenged the

order of NGT dated 13.1.2015 in the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_137">40.   The National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi in M.A.

No.419/2014 in Original Application No.123 of 2014 Himmat Singh

Shekhawat V/s State of Rajasthan and ors. (decided on 13.1.2015) had an

occasion to consider the application filed by the National Green Tribunal

Bar Association under <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_26">Sections 14</a> and <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_27">15</a> read with <a href="/doc/192670971/" id="a_28">sections 18(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/192670971/" id="a_29">18</a>

(2) of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_30">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010, alleging rampant illegal sand

mining in the Yamuna riverbed in violation of the directions issued by the

Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar V/s state of Haryana ((2012) 4 SCC 629)

and the direction issued for mining of mineral for less than 5 hectares in

para 29 of the judgment, in which it was held that "Leases of minor

mineral including their renewal for an area of less than five hectares be

granted by the States/Union Territories only after getting environmental

clearance from the MoEF".
</p>
<p id="p_138">41.   The NGT considered the stand of the State of Rajasthan in respect

of compliance of the directions issued in Deepak Kumar's case in

paragraphs 30, 31 and 32 of the judgment and held that the deeming

fiction contained in proviso to Rule 37Q would not stand the scrutiny of

law. The NGT held in clear terms that the Rules amended by the State of

Rajasthan are not in line with the dictum of Hon'ble Supreme Court and

even the Notifications of MoEF including notification of 2006. It also held

in paragraph 70 that the consideration and grant of environmental

clearance is statutorily regulated by the Notification of MoEF of 2006 and

the State Government would not be competent to alter or completely give

a go-bye to the said statutory procedure and methodology. The

environmental clearance has to be granted in accordance with the Central

law and thus, the contention raised in the present case on same lines

cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_139">42.   The attempt of the State of Rajasthan to circumvent the law and

directions issued by the Supreme Court was held to be over-reaching the

order of the Supreme Court. Paragraphs 30, 31, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 74 and

part of paragraph 75 of the judgment of NGT dated 13.1.2015 and the

recommendations made by NGT in paragraph 83 of the judgment are

quoted below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_63">      "30. We may now notice the stand taken by the respective States
      before the Tribunal in the above case.</blockquote><p id="p_140">

</p><p id="p_141">            State of Rajasthan has taken a common stand in two of these
      cases (Appeal No. 23 of 2014 and Original Application No. 123 of
      2014). It is stated on behalf of the State that, Respondent No. 1,
      Sanjay Bakliwal, in Appeal No. 23 was granted consent to establish
      and operate on 26th November, 2012. This respondent was granted
      lease for mining of minor minerals on 23rd November, 2012. In
      furtherance to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
      case of Deepak Kumar (supra), all the States were directed to
      consider the recommendations of the Committee which were
      recorded in the judgment and were directed to frame their rules
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                              42</span>

and their mining policy. Accordingly, the State of Rajasthan
amended the State Rules w.e.f. 19th June, 2012 by incorporating
Chapter IVA for scientific and eco-friendly mining. Under the
amended Rules, the mining area allowed for mining of minor
minerals is 1 hectare. Obtaining Environmental Clearance, for
carrying on river sand mining activity, in an area of less than 5
hectares, was not required. Such requirement was introduced vide
Notification dated 9th September, 2013. Lease holders carrying on
the minor mineral activity were to apply for Environmental
Clearance at the time of renewal as per the Notification of 9th
September, 2013. This Notification made prior grant of
Environmental Clearance mandatory in relation to river sand mining
and provided that Environmental Clearance will only be required at
the stage of renewal of mining in the cases of existing lease.

</p><p id="p_142">31. State of Rajasthan, as noticed above, had amended its rules
and particularly introduced Rules 37P, 37Q, 37R, 37S, reference
to which would be necessary. Rule 37P provided for grant of short
term permits for mining in an area of less than 5 hectares.
Association of lessees could, through recognised persons, submit
Environment Management Plan to the District Level Environmental
Committee for approval. The association was to be formed within
three months from declaration of cluster. Under this, various
persons would become Members of the association and apply for
cluster mining. Even a person falling within a cluster was deemed to
be a member of the association. 37R provided for the composition of
the District Level Environmental Committee. Environment
Management Plan had to be approved by such Committee, which was
required to be implemented in terms of Rule 37S. This was to
provide environmental safeguards which were to be implemented by
the holders of the short term permits and the association. According
to Respondent No. 1, the lessee, he had complied with all these
requirements and as per Government practise, clusters were formed
by the State Government and Environment Management Plan was
approved by the District Environmental Committee. However,
Respondent No. 1 also submits that, during the operation of the
orders of the Tribunal, he had applied for obtaining Environmental
Clearance. The Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board, vide its
letter dated 31st October, 2013, also directed Respondent No. 1 that
if they wished to increase the production after 9th September,
2013, they must obtain Environmental Clearance. It is the stand of
the Respondents that ToR has been issued by SEIAA and public
hearing has been done on 27th-28th August, 2014 and that they are
awaiting grant of Environmental Clearance. According to Respondent
No. 1, the Notification dated 9th September, 2013, is not applicable
to the lease as it operates only prospectively.
</p>
<p id="p_143">68. State of Rajasthan has also amended its Rules after the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar (supra).
Rajasthan Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1986 were amended by
Notification dated 3rd May, 2012. Under these Rules, there are three
most noticeable aspects. First relates to permission for carrying on
mining activity in an area of less than 5 hectares, that too without
obtaining the Environmental Clearance from SEIAA/MoEF. It has
created District Level Environmental Committees to whom
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                               43</span>

application of Environmental Clearance is to be moved and which
has to recommend grant/refusal of such clearances. It has permitted
cluster-mining by stating that an Environmental Management Plan
could be submitted for such cluster mining and permits could be
given for an area of less than 5 hectares. The short-term permit
holders of the lease in clusters were required to form an association
and file applications along with the Environment Management Plan
to the District Committee for approval in terms of Rule 37P. Under
proviso to this Rule, the permit holders of short-term permits within
the boundary of the cluster after formation of the association will
be deemed to be members of the association. All these three issues
are not in conformity with the law in force and the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court. Secondly, they also suffer from the infirmity
of imposing obligations on a person who may not be desirous of
becoming a member of the association within the cluster
boundaries. In our considered view, the 'deeming fiction' contained
in proviso to Rule 37Q would not stand the scrutiny of law. It is in
fact impractical as well as unsustainable. This would encourage
what the Hon'ble Supreme Court has specifically discourage in the
case of Deepak Kumar (supra) that persons carrying on mining
activity should not be permitted by creating smaller segments of the
areas of the mining activity and then forming a cluster or even
without forming the clusters carrying on the mining activity
degrading the environment and ecology of the area. The Rules
amended by the State of Rajasthan thus, are not in line with the
dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and even the Notifications
issued by the MoEF including the Notification of 2006.

</p><p id="p_144">69. The Union Parliament is vested with the powers of making laws
for regulation and development of mines and minerals so far they
are expedient in public interest. Similarly, legislative power is
vested in the State but it is subject to the provisions of List I. The
Parliament having enacted the Act of 1957, the Rules for regulation
that can be framed by the State Legislature under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_31">Section 15</a> of the
said Act has to be compliant of the Parliamentary legislation. In
other words, whatever rules are to be framed by the State
Government, they should be in conformity with the Act of 1957 as
well as with the Act of 1986. In terms of <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_32">Article 141</a> of the
Constitution, the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is the law
of the land and is binding on all concerned. The State Government
while framing Rules in exercise of powers of delegated legislation
has to be conscious of the fact that such legislation is expected to
be in conformity with the law of the land as declared by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court. The said Rules thus, so framed have to be in
conformity with all, the two enactments, i.e., the Act of 1957 and
Act of 1986 and Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The
constitution of District Level Environmental Committee for the
purpose of considering and approving the Environment Management
Plan in terms of proviso to Rule 37(Q) is another provision that
requires consideration. Under the Notification of 2006, the projects
whether falling in category 'A', 'B', 'B1'or 'B2' have to be
considered for the purposes of grant of Environmental Clearance and
other related matters by MoEF/SEIAA. The District Level Committee
is neither framed under the provisions of the Act or Rules of 1986
and for that matter, nor under the Notification of 2006. Once the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                               44</span>

law provides for a particular procedure to be done or undertaken in
a particular manner and by a specified authority, then it can be
done in that manner alone by that authority and not in any other
way. Even in the case of Deepak Kumar (supra), the Hon'ble
Supreme Court had permitted consideration of Environmental
Clearance application only by SEIAA or MoEF. It was contended that
such Committees were only expected to recommend the cases to
SEIAA and not to grant or refuse Environmental Clearances. Firstly,
this submission is not supported by any of the Rule. The Rules 37P
and 37Q clearly requires that an Environmental Management Plan for
cluster would be approved by the Committee. In that context, the
expression 'approval' cannot be granted, any other meaning except
that a final 'decision' in that regard will be taken. Once approval is
granted by the District Level Environmental Committee, it is
impractical to imagine, how it would be able to decline
Environmental Clearance. In other words, it is a machinery created
by the Rules which is in derogation to the Principle legislation and
the Notification of 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_145">70. At this stage, we may revert to the judgment of the Tribunal
dated 28th November, 2013, in the case of National Green Tribunal
Bar Association (supra). In this judgment, the Tribunal specifically
rejected the contention of the State of Madhya Pradesh that in view
of Rules 42 to 49 and 68 of the Madhya Pradesh Minor Mineral Rules,
1996, the State has given authority to the District Level
Environmental Committees to grant lease or license in accordance
with the Rules. Amendment of the Rules, by the State Governments,
cannot be done so as to entirely wipe out the impact, effect and
procedure prescribed in the Central law. The District Level
Environmental Committees so constituted have to perform their
functions under the Act of 1957 and the Rules framed therein. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_33">The
Act</a> does not empower the State authorities to grant Environmental
Clearance. The Tribunal further held that the appropriate way to
read and interpret these Sections would be that such powers are to
be exercised in relation to environment but primarily for the
purposes of granting or refusing mining leases or licences. The
consideration and grant of Environmental Clearance is statutorily
regulated by the Notification of 2006 and the State Government
would not be competent to alter or completely give a go-by to the
said statutory procedure and methodology, the Environmental
Clearance has to be granted in accordance with the Central law.
Thus, the contentions raised in the present case on similar lines
cannot be accepted by us as well.
</p>
<p id="p_146">71. The Hon'ble Supreme Court had permitted preparation of Mining
Plan primarily with the object of providing for reclamation and
rehabilitation of the mined out area. It was to deal with progressive
mine closure plan and post mined land of use. The Judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court had also dealt with cluster mining approach
for small size mines. The purpose of adopting cluster approach with
reference to small mine leases was to take care of preparation of
Environmental Management Plan in clusters of mines, where the
mining activity was being carried out in smaller areas. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court accepted the recommendation of MoEF in regard to
the above. The Hon'ble Supreme Court specifically noticed, what
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                45</span>

was pointed by the CEC to examine, whether there has been an
attempt to flout the Notification of 2006 by breaking of homogenous
area into pieces of less than 5 hectares. The Hon'ble Supreme Court
upon taking note of the recommendations of MoEF which were
passed on technical, scientific and environmental grounds, had
directed     the    State    Governments     to    implement     the
recommendations. They were directed to get the Mining Plan
prepared as afore-noticed. Besides all these, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court had directed that lease of minor minerals, including their
renewal, for an area of less than 5 hectares is granted by the said
Union Territories/State only after getting Environmental Clearance
from the MoEF.
</p><p id="p_147">       From the above discussion, it is clear that there is apparent
contradiction between the Rules framed by the State under the
shelter of the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Deepak Kumar (supra) on the one hand and the Central Law and
Notifications on the other. This has created uncertainty in fact and
in law. To put it more plainly, the actions taken by the State
Governments post the case of Deepak Kumar (supra) has created
more problems than it ought to have solved by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in its judgment. Thus, the State Government and MoEF needs
to examine the matter collectively, objectively and with an intent
to bring uniformity in law. We would issue directions in this regard
separately.
</p>
<p id="p_148">72. India is not only a diverse country in relation to culture,
language and character, but, it is also materially distinct and
different in relation to geography, ecology and environment. Narrow
rivers in the mid of the hills, limited riverbed space, snowing peaks
and high altitude on the one hand and on the other huge river and
riverbed, wide field areas are the indicators of this diversity. It may
be difficult to have a uniform policy or law in relation to activities,
like mining, particularly minor minerals, which have a very serious
impact on the environment, ecology and river flow. There is a dire
need to formulate the laws which may be State specific but do not
degrade or damage the environment and ecology. Any damage to
the environment and ecology may be happening in one State but its
adverse impacts would be seen on the entire nation. Therefore,
there is a need for an effective and protective Central Legislation
which will not only protect the environment in a particular area but
the entire Indian Territory.
</p>
<p id="p_149">74. Another argument that has been advanced on behalf of the
States, as well as, some of the respondents is that the Notification
published by MoEF dated 9th September, 2013, which makes it
compulsory for the minor mineral mining lease holders of area of
less than 5 hectares to seek Environmental Clearance is not
retrospective and therefore, will not be applicable to the mine
leases that were in force as on that date. Firstly, we have already
quashed and declared the Notification dated 9th September, 2013 as
ineffective and inoperative, having not been issued in consonance
with the provisions of law. As such, this argument would hardly
survive. Since this argument may have some bearing even in relation
to the other Office Memorandums issued by MoEF or on other
Notifications validly issued by MoEF such as the one dated 1st
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                               46</span>

December, 2009 and Office Memorandum of 24th June, 2013 and
24th December, 2013, we will even proceed to discuss the merits of
this submission.
</p>
<p id="p_150">75...In that sense and somewhat loosely, it can be interpreted as
being retroactive in nature, as they do not take away the right of
the person to carry on business or his industrial unit, but only
impose a new obligation to take Environmental Clearance under the
environmental laws. The activity is not prohibited, but, compliance
to the environmental laws is made mandatory. Examined from that
angle, in so far as we have held, the Notification dated 1st
December, 2009, Office Memorandums dated 18th May, 2012, 24th
June, 2013 and 24th December, 2013, except to the extent they
have been quashed as above by us, are valid and would be
enforceable against even the existing mining lease holders. They
cannot be permitted to destroy the environment and ecology for
their personal gains on the strength of the contention that they are
existing units and these Notifications, Office Memorandums would
not apply to them.
</p>
<p id="p_151">83. In light of the above discussion and particularly keeping in view
the persistent conflict between the State Regulations and the
Central Notifications, it is imperative for us to issue directions
specially to provide for an interim period, during which appropriate
steps should be taken to comply with the Judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court and to issue Notifications which are necessary in that
regard. Therefore, we pass the following order and directions:

I. For the reasons afore recorded, we hold and declare that the
Notification dated 9th September, 2013 is invalid and inoperative for
non-compliance of the statutorily prescribed procedure under the
Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 and for absence of any
justifiable reason for dispensation of such procedure.

II. We also hold and declare that the Office Memorandums dated
24th June, 2013 and 24th December, 2013 to the extent afore-
indicated are invalid and inoperative being beyond the power of
delegated legislation.
</p>
<p id="p_152">III. All the Office Memorandums and Notifications issued by MoEF i.e.
1st December, 2009, 18th May, 2012 and 24th June, 2013 and 24th
December, 2013(except to the extent afore-stated) are operative
and would apply to the lease mine holders irrespective of the fact
that whether the area involved is more or less than 5 hectares.

IV. We further hold that the existing mining lease right holders
would also have to comply with the requirement of obtaining
Environmental Clearance from the competent authorities in
accordance with law. However, all of them, if not already granted
Environmental Clearance would be entitled to a reasonable period
(say three months) to submit their applications for obtaining the
same, which shall be disposed of expeditiously and in any case not
later than six months from pronouncement of this judgment.

V. All the States and the Ministry of Environment and Forest shall
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                47</span>

ensure strict compliance to the directions issued by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Deepak Kumar (supra). We direct
Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forest to hold a meeting
with the State of Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka to
bring complete uniformity in application of the above referred
Notifications and Office Memorandums including the Notification of
2006.
</p>
<p id="p_153">VI. We direct that in the meeting it shall also disused            and
appropriate recommendations be made and placed before              the
Tribunal, as to whether riverbed mining covering an area of        less
than 5 hectares can be permitted, if so, the conditions            and
regulatory measures that need to be adopted in that behalf.

VII. We direct that the District Environmental Committees
constituted by the respective State Governments shall not discharge
any functions and grant approval as contemplated under the
Notification of 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_154">VIII. Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forest along with such
experts and the States afore-referred will also consider the
possibility of constituting the branches of SEIAA at the district or at
least, division levels, to ensure easy accessibility to encourage the
mine holders to take Environmental Clearance expeditiously.

IX. It is stated before us that in large number of cases, particularly
in relation of State of Rajasthan, persons carrying on mining activity
of minor minerals, non-coal mining and brick earth and ordinary
earth have applied for obtaining Environmental Clearances in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Notification of
2006. Let all such applications be dealt with and orders passed by
the concerned authorities at the earliest and in any case not later
than six months from today.
</p>
<p id="p_155">X. We direct the respondent authorities, particularly SEIAA, to
dispose of the application of all these private respondents who have
already filed applications seeking Environmental Clearance as
expeditiously as possible, in any case not later than three months
from today. Thus, Appeal No. 23/2014 and M.A. No. 469/2014, M.A.
No. M.A No. 488/2014, 489/2014, 479/2014, 480/2014, 473/2014,
470/2014, 471/2014 and 469/2014 stand disposed of with the above
directions. Till the grant of environmental clearance they would not
carry out any activity of marble mining.
</p>
<p id="p_156">XI. We dispose of Original Application No. 123/13 with a direction
that SEIAA shall consider the applications filed for seeking
Environmental Clearance in accordance with law and observations
made in this judgment, expeditiously, and in any case within a
period of three months from today.
</p>
<p id="p_157">XII. In the meanwhile, no State shall permit carrying on of sand
mining or minor mineral extraction on riverbed or otherwise without
the concerned person obtaining Environmental Clearance from the
competent authority.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                     48</span><p id="p_158">

</p><p id="p_159">      XIII. We direct the Ministry of Environment and Forest to issue
      comprehensive but self-contained Notification relating to all minor
      mineral activity on the riverbed or otherwise, to avoid unnecessary
      confusion, ambiguities and practical difficulties in implementation
      of the environmental laws.
</p>
<p id="p_160">      XIV. In light of the judgment of the Supreme Court and what has
      emerged from the various cases that are subject matter of this
      Judgment, we direct the Ministry of Environment and Forest to
      formulate a uniform cluster policy in consultation with the States for
      permitting minor mineral mining activity including, its regulatory
      regime, in accordance with law."
</p>
<p id="p_161">
</p><p id="p_162">43.   The Additional Advocate General has defended the amended Rules

and the grant of mining leases, quarry licenses and short-term permits

between 19.6.2012 and 9.9.2013 including the areas less than 5 hectares

and the deemed renewals in 622 cases, on the ground that the State had

ample authority, to grant and to review such mining leases, quarry licenses

and short term permits, after amending the Rules pending consideration of

the compliance affidavit filed by the State of Rajasthan before the

Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's cases. It is submitted that NGT did not

have jurisdiction to declare the Rules made by the State of Rajasthan to

be in violation of the MoEF Notification and the directions issued in Deepak

Kumar's case. The Special Leave Petition challenging the order of NGT

dated 13.1.2015 by the State of Rajasthan is pending.

</p><p id="p_163">44.   It is submitted that the public interest litigation in respect of the

same matter, in which the compliance report has been filed by the State

of Rajasthan before the Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's case, is not

maintainable. The State Government has sought approval of the Rules by

filing a compliance affidavit in the Supreme Court and that during the

pendency of such approval, the High Court in exercise of powers under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_34">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India will be travelling beyond its

jurisdiction in adjudicating on validity of the amended Rules.

</p><p id="p_164">45.   We have considered the submissions made by learned counsel for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                    49</span>

the parties and perused the documents as well as materials placed on

record.
</p>
<p id="p_165">46.   In our view, we will be well within our jurisdiction in case we

examine and adjudicate over the validity of the amended Rules, on the

touchstone of the directions issued by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Deepak

Kumar's case. An affidavit was filed by the State of Rajasthan before the

Supreme Court, in compliance of the directions dated 27.2.2012 in Deepak

Kumar's case, annexing therewith amended Rules vide Notification dated

19.6.2012. We are informed that the affidavit alongwith the amended

Rules has not been considered by Hon'ble Supreme Court so far. We are

further informed that the Supreme Court has passed several orders       in

Deepak Kumar's case, but no effective order mandating compliance of the

directions dated 27.2.2012 for the State of Rajasthan on its application

annexing the amendment in the Rules, has been passed so far.

</p><p id="p_166">47.   We are distressed to observe that in the meantime, taking shelter

behind the compliance of the Rules, as it has been noticed by the National

Greens Tribunal in its order dated 13th January, 2015 and without seeking

approval of the Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's case, the State

Government, considering itself to be the final arbiter of the compliance,

has granted 444 mining leases, 86 quarry licenses and 7874 short term

permits for the area less than 5 hectare and has renewed the existing

quarry licenses, of which number has not been given from 19.6.2012 to

9.9.2013, and further, from 19.6.2012 to 31.12.2014, 10478 mining

plans/schemes have been approved including 672 deemed approvals, out

of which, on scrutiny, 50 deemed approvals were rejected. The State of

Rajasthan has in complete defiance of the Notification issued by the MoEF

dated 14.9.2006 and without waiting for the approval of Hon'ble Supreme

Court to the amendment in the Rules, made by it on 19.6.2012, virtually
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                         50</span>

made the grant of mining leases, quarry licenses and short term permits,

free on first come first serve basis.
</p>
<p id="p_167">48.   We are not impressed with the submission that the change of

definition of "cluster", submission of Environmental Management Plan for

cluster of leases/licenses/short term permits for an area less than 5

hectares individually, preparation of Environmental Management Plan by

the association of cluster and its approval by the District            Level

Environmental Committee and the imposition of alleged 58 conditions, all

of which are for seeking compliance by the Association of lease holders,

the alleged violators of law, for purported safeguards of environment by

these clusters, for compliance of environment conditions, is in the best

interest of protecting environment in the State. The State of Rajasthan has

brazenly with impunity, for serving its own end, has permitted plundering

of the non-renewable natural wealth of the State, for exploiting the

minerals by grant of mining leases in violation of Notification dated

14.9.2006 issued by the MoEF, the recommendations of MoEF in its report

of March 2010, and the Model Rules of 2010 issued by the Ministry of Mines,

Government of India, as well as the directions issued by the Supreme Court

in Deepak Kumar's case. We find that the insertion of Rules 37P to 37U vide

Notification dated 19.6.2012 is clearly violative of Notification of the MoEF

dated 14th September, 2006, the recommendations of MoEF in its report of

March 2010, the Model Rules of 2010 issued by the Ministry of Mines,

Government of India, and the directions issued in Deepak Kumar's case.

The Notification of MoEF dated 14.9.2006 was not applicable to the mines

with the area less than 5 hectares. The lacuna was filled by the directions

issued in Deepak Kumar's case, in which it was clearly held that the

conditions of Notification of the MoEF will apply to all those mining leases,

which are for the area less than 5 hectares.

</p><p id="p_169">49.     The clustering was prohibited by the Division Bench of this Court

vide judgment dated 19.8.2011 in D.B.Writ (PIL) Petition No.10304/2010

against which Special Leave Petition was dismissed. The clustering is thus

clearly violative of the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court dated

19.8.2011 and that the grant and renewal of the mining leases, quarry

licenses and short term permits, after submission of Environmental

Management Plan to the District Level Environmental Committee, did not

serve the purpose of protecting the environment, inasmuch as, the District

Level   Environmental   Committee        has   no   nominee   of    the   Central

Government, nor any expert of the Central Government is associated in

examining the Environmental Management Plan and Environmental

Management Fund for environment development work. The entire burden

of protecting the environment has been left to the person, who are

members of the Association formed as per the provisions of Rule 37Q. The

entire object of protecting the environment from those, who degrade the

environment, has been thwarted by laying the responsibility for protection

of environment on the same persons, without State's intervention and by

providing   for   handing   over    of   the   amount   collected    under   the

Environmental Management           Fund to the same persons, namely, the

Association of cluster, to carry out restoration of flora and fauna.

</p><p id="p_170">50.     The report of the Core Committee referred to in the order of the

Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's case, had recommended that the

minimum size of mine lease should be 5 hectares. The preparation of

comprehensive mine plan for contiguous stretches of mineral deposits by

the respective State Government may also be encouraged and may be

suitably incorporated in the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 by the Ministry

of Mines. This recommendation was made after noticing that in Rajasthan,

the minimum limit for a lease is one hectare and the maximum area for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                     52</span>

permit is 50x50 mtrs. The recommendation was made to bring uniformity,

which has not been considered in the amended Rules. The State of

Rajasthan has also failed to consider the desirability under clause 4.4. of

the report of the Core Committee. The desirability to adopt cluster

approach was recommended in case of smaller mine leases being operated

presently and not for fresh grant. Further, the clusters              were

recommended to be provided with processing/crusher zones for forward

integration and minimizing excessive pressure on road infrastructure, with

further emphasis that    the respective State Governments/Mine Owners

Associations may facilitate implementation of Environmental Management

Plans in such cluster of mines. The State Government has in complete

violation of the recommendations adopted approach of cluster of mines for

the purpose of preparing Environmental Management Fund to be

implemented by the Association itself without any safeguards.

</p><p id="p_171">51.   We find substance in the contention of learned counsel appearing

for the petitioner that the reclamation and rehabilitation of mined out

areas should be brought under strict regulatory regime and carried out

under an approved framework of mining plan. The mining plan should take

note of the level of production, level of mechanisation, type of machinery

used in the mining of minor minerals, quantity of diesel consumption,

number of trees uprooted, export and import of mining minerals,

environmental impact, restoration of flora and host of other matters

referred to in 2010 Rules. We do not find any such precaution in the

amended Rules beginning from Rules 37P to 37U. The 58 conditions put by

the District Level Environmental Committee have been referred to these

conditions, but their implementation has been conceived through the

association, without intervention of State and providing any regulatory

regime. The location of eco-fragile region within the impact zone of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                    53</span>

proposed mining area, has also not been taken into consideration and for

which, no details have been provided by the State Government in the

affidavit filed in the petition. In fact, the State Government has not

provided any material as to how many applications were rejected on

account of non-conformity with the Rules or the conditions put by the

District Level Environmental Committee, which goes to show that all

applications were allowed on submission of EMP's.
</p>
<p id="p_172">52.   Learned Additional Advocate General submits that the District Level

Environmental Committee includes an expert, to be nominated by the

State Government and that the deeming provision is being applied with

great care and caution, which is reflected in the rejection of 50 deemed

approvals, out of 672. He also submits that the State Government will take

care of the rational expenditure for reclamation and rehabilitation out of

Rs.219 crores recovered and credited to the Environmental Management

Fund since its imposition in June, 2012. The qualifications of the expert

have not been provided, nor his nomination by the State Government is in

conformity with the directions issued by MoEF. The reclamation and

rehabilitation being a continuous process alongwith the mining activity,

the non-expenditure of any amount out of the Environmental Management

Fund of Rs.219 crores, belies the claim of the State Government that it is

taking care of reclamation and rehabilitation of mined out areas and for

protection of flora and fauna.
</p>
<p id="p_173">53.   The State of Rajasthan is endowed with rich deposits of mineral

accumulated in its Arawali range of hills, which are older than Himalayas.

This non-renewable source of minerals is the wealth of the Nation, which

has to be protected for future generations. It cannot be allowed to be

plundered by unscrupulous persons having no concern for environment.

We must remember that we have not received this wealth as a gift from
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                     54</span>

our ancestors. We have to preserve it and owe the responsibility to pass it

on to the coming generations. We are trustees of this wealth for handing it

over to our future generations. We are allowed to use it prudently for only

our needs and not for our greed, safely keeping in mind the environmental

concerns. The principles of inter-generational equity have to be balanced

with sustainable development. The State of Rajasthan has not placed

before us any plan much less a long term plan, to put new areas for mining

keeping in view the principles of inter-generational equity balanced with

sustainable development.
</p>
<p id="p_174">54.   We find it difficult to appreciate the hurry, in which the State

Government implemented the amended Rules before waiting for its

approval by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's case. There was no

urgency to lease out the new mining areas or to renew the mining leases

until the Supreme Court had an occasion to examine the amendments

made in the Rules. The anxiety to grant mining leases without waiting for

the scrutiny by the Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's case, shows the

mala-fides of the State Government in granting leases, in violation of the

Notifications issued by the MoEF, which are binding upon the State

Government, the recommendations of MoEF in its report of 2010 and the

Model Rules of 2010 issued by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India.

</p><p id="p_175">55.   We do not propose to decide the question as to whether the

National Green Tribunal has jurisdiction under the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_35">National Green Tribunal

Act</a>, 2010, to declare the Notification issued by the MoEF dispensing with

the statutory procedure under the Environment (Protection) Rule, 1986

and the office memorandums issued in other States in violation of the

Notifications issued by the MoEF, to be invalid and inoperative being

beyond the power of the legislation. We also do not want to examine the

jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal, to issue directions in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                     55</span>

paragraph 83 of the judgment dated 13th January, 2015. The order dated

13.1.2015 has not been challenged before us and thus, the matter has to

be decided by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the SLP filed by the State of

Rajasthan.
</p>
<p id="p_176">56.   We have, however, taken the benefit of the reasoning in the order

of NGT, for the purpose of examining the challenge to the amended Rules.

We find that the reasons given by the NGT are cogent, germane and serve

the environmental concern, which is a fundamental duty under <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_36">Article 51-

A(g)</a> of the Constitution of India. The protection of environment, is a

concern of all citizens. The State Government cannot be allowed to

circumvent to violate the Notification issued by the Ministry of

Environment and Forests, the recommendations in the report of MoEF of

March 2010, and the Model Guidelines issued by the Ministry of Mines,

Government of India 2010, to allow the natural wealth of the Nation to be

plundered by the State Government, to degrade the environment.

</p><p id="p_177">57.   We may observe here that the object of enacting the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_37">Environment

(Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and for issuing Notification under the Environment

(Protection) Rules, 1986 made under the Act is to look into environmental

issues in a larger perspective. The State Governments, as it was noticed in

T.N.Godavarman's case, have for political and commercial gains, degraded

the environment to a large extent. The State Governments are unable to

see the impact of their activities in the national perspective. The

environment concerns are not limited to boundaries of the State. These

concerns are addressed by the experts at National level. Looking at the

environment, in a holistic way, the State Governments cannot be

permitted to continue its policy and were required to bring the policy in

tune with the Notifications issued by the MoEF prepared after intervention

and deliberation by experts at national and international level. The State
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                        56</span>

Governments have always found ways to circumvent the Notification issued

by the MoEF to serve its narrow end. The present case is the classic

example, in which the State of Rajasthan despite the Notification issued

by the MoEF under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 made under

the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_38">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and the directions issued by the

Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's case, has found its way in the purported

compliance of the order in Deepak Kumar's case to issue mining leases,

quarry licenses and short term permits, without insisting and obtaining

Environmental Clearance from the State Level Environment Impact

Assessment Authority. The District Collector sitting with the Member of the

State Pollution Control Board and           the Mining Engineer, has allowed

leases, quarry licenses and short term permits, taking advantage of

deeming clause, without obtaining Environmental Clearance from the

SLEIAA. The assurance given to the Court that the Environmental

Management Plans considered by the District Level Environmental

Committee are sufficient to protect the environment, is a submission,

which is not worth of consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_178">58.   We find it prudent to adopt the reasoning given by the National

Green Tribunal in para 68 of its order dated 13th January, 2015, in which it

observed that the Rules amended by the State Government are not in line

with the dictum of Hon'ble Supreme Court and even the Notifications

issued by the MoEF including the Notification of 2006, on three noticeable

aspects. The first relates to permission for carrying on mining activity in an

area less than 5 hectares, that too without obtaining the environmental

clearance   from    SLEIAA/MoEF.       The     District   Level   Environmental

Committees, to whom the applications have to be made, are not

competent to grant environmental clearance, in view of the Notification

issued by the MoEF. The State Government has also permitted cluster
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                            57</span>

mining, in which permits could be given for an area less than 5 hectares.

The formation of Association by the short term permit holders of the lease

in cluster and that the permit holders of short-term permits within the

boundary of cluster after formation of Association will be deemed to be

the members of the Association, is not in conformity with the Notification

of MoEF and the directions of the Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's case.

The Rules also suffer from infirmity of imposing obligations on a person,

who may not be desirous of becoming a member of the Association within

the cluster boundaries. The deeming fiction contained in Rule 37Q also

does not stand the scrutiny of law and is held to be impracticable and

unsustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_179">59.     We are unable to appreciate the merit of the defence of the State

of Rajasthan that pending approval of the Rules, namely, Rajasthan Minor

Mineral Concession (Amendment) Rules, 2012 and the Rajasthan Minor

Mineral Concession (Second Amendment) Rules 2012 promulgated on 23rd

May, 2012 and 19th June, 2012 respectively by Hon'ble Supreme Court in

Deepak Kumar's case, the State of Rajasthan could have allowed the

implementation of the Rules, contrary to the object and purpose and the

mandate of Notification issued by the MoEF. The State of Rajasthan has

clearly over-reached the directions issued in Deepak Kumar's case, which

had prohibited it in more than clear terms to allow leases of minor mineral

including their renewal for an area of less than 5 hectares, to be granted

by    the     State    Governments/Union         Territories   only   after   getting

Environmental Clearance from MoEF.
</p>
<p id="p_180">60.     In our view, the State Government has not only tried to over-reach

the order of Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 27.2.2012 in Deepak Kumar's

case,    it    has    grossly   violated   the     statutory   provisions     of   the

Notifications        issued by the MoEF for protection of environment of not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                      58</span>

only of Rajasthan, but of the entire country. It has for its narrow political

and       shortsighted commercial purposes, granted hundreds of mining

leases, quarry licenses and short term permits and renewals, without

obtaining Environmental Clearance from the MoEF. The enactments of the

offending Rules 37P to 37U in the Rajasthan Minor Mineral Concession

Rules, 1986, by    Rajasthan Minor         Mineral Concession (Amendment)

Rules, 2012 and the Rajasthan Minor           Mineral   Concession (Second

Amendment) Rules 2012 notified on 23rd May, 2012 and 19th June, 2012

respectively are thus found to be    illegal and ultra vires the Notification

dated 14.9.2006 issued by the        Ministry of Environment and Forests,

Government of India, as interpreted in the order of the Supreme Court

dated 27.2.2012 in Deepak Kumar's case.
</p>
<p id="p_181">61.   The writ petition is allowed. The impugned amendment in the

Rajasthan Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1986 inserting Rules 37P to 37U

by Notification dated 19.6.2012 is declared to be illegal, without

jurisdiction and ultra vires, with directions that the amended Rules shall

not be implemented any further, until they receive express approval of

Hon'ble Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar etc. V/s State of Haryana and

ors. etc. (Special Leave petition (C) No.19628-19629 of 2009). The State

of Rajasthan is restrained from granting any further mining leases, quarry

licenses and short term permits including the renewal of existing mining

leases/quarry licenses/short term permits, except only after getting the

Environmental Clearance from the State Level Environment Impact

Assessment Authority under the Notification of the Ministry of Environment

and Forests, Government of India          dated 14th September, 2006, the

recommendations in the report of MoEF of March, 2010 and the Model

Guidelines issued by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India in 2010.

The mining leases, quarry licenses and short term permits granted from
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                         59</span>

    19.6.2012 to 9.9.2013, the renewals and the deemed approvals between

    19.6.2012 and 31.12.2014, without obtaining Environmental Clearance

    from the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority under the

    Notification of MoEF dated 14th September, 2006, will be allowed to

    operate for a reasonable period i.e. 3 months only if they have not been

    granted Environmental Clearance. The lessees/quarry licensees/short term

    permit holders can submit the applications for obtaining the same, which

    shall be disposed of expeditiously and in any case in less than three

    months, after which the mining activity in all these mines, which have not

    obtained Environmental Clearance from the State Level Environment

    Impact Assessment Authority, shall be ceased. All the mines in the State of

    Rajasthan operating without Environmental Clearance from the State Level

    Environment Impact Assessment Authority, shall cease to operate after a

    period of three months.
</p>
<p id="p_182">    62.   We further direct that the State of Rajasthan shall ensure strict

    compliance of the directions issued by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Deepak

    Kumar's case and will not issue any fresh leases, licenses and permits and

    pass any order on the application for renewal until the consideration of its

    application annexing amendment in the Rules before Hon'ble Supreme

    Court in Deepak Kumar's case.
</p>
<p id="p_183">    63.   The petitioner is made entitled to Rs.one lac, as costs of filing and

    pursuing the writ petition in public interest for protecting the

    environment. The amount of costs shall be paid by the State of Rajasthan

    to the petitioner within a period of one month from today.
