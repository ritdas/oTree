(By Shri. D. Nagaraj, Advocate for Respondent No.1)

                              *****
      This Criminal Petition is filed under Section 482 code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973, praying to quash the complaint in
C.C.No.286/2007 on the file of the Civil Judge (Jr.Dn.) and
Judicial Magistrate First Class, Chikkanayakanally.

      This petition is coming on for Final Hearing this day, the
court made the following:

                            ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioners and the

respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       2. The petitioners are said to be carrying on the business

of extracting iron ore under a Mining Lease granted by the

Government of Karnataka at the mines located at Gollarahalli,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>




Chikkanayakanahally Taluk, Tumkur District.       The petitioners

claim to have obtained consent from the respondent for the

mining activity as required under the Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,1981 (Hereinafter referred to as the

'<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air Act</a>', for brevity) in terms of a letter dated 18.6.2004, with

a condition that the ore extracted should not be more than 7900

Metric Tonnes per annum and this was effective from

18.6.2004.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">      2. Before the grant of consent, certain directions had

been issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests,

Government of India, in order to ensure compliance with the

environmental laws, particularly the environment impact

assessment, which was required to be complied with by the

Mines operators on or before 31.3.2003. The petitioners had

applied for consent in terms of their application dated

12.12.2002. It is the case of the petitioners that there was no

need for the petitioners to comply with the directions issued by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  4</span>




the Ministry of Environment and Forests          and since the

petitioners intended to increase the quantum of ore mined at the

subject mines, they had applied to the Government for

permission in that regard, which granted its permission as on

12.9.2006 for increase in the extraction of ore from 7900 Metric

Tonnes to 80000 Metric Tonnes per annum. The petitioners

then learnt that the respondent had filed a complaint under

<a href="/doc/1670661/" id="a_3">Section 20</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973

(Hereinafter referred to as the '<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Cr.PC</a>', for brevity),   alleging

that the petitioners had violated the provisions of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_5">Sections 21</a>

and <a href="/doc/1161070/" id="a_6">22</a> of the Air Act punishable under <a href="/doc/1296808/" id="a_7">Section 37</a> of the Air

Act before the Court of the Civil Judge (Junior Division) and

JMFC, Chikkanayakanahalli, which had registered a complaint

and after taking cognizance, had directed the registration of a

criminal case and had issued process against the petitioners in a

case in CC No.286/2007.          Aggrieved by the same, the

petitioners are before this court.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                5</span><p id="p_5">




</p><p id="p_6">      3. The learned Counsel for the petitioners would contend

that the complaint does not disclose the violation of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_8">Sections 21</a>

or 22 of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a> by the petitioners. There is no specific

allegation indicating that any such offence has been committed

and therefore no action could have been taken on such a vague

complaint and even according to the respondent, consent to

extract the iron ore was granted in terms of Annexure -1 to the

complaint, which is dated 17.6.2004 and by grant of such

consent, non-compliance by the petitioners with any direction

issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests,

Government of India or violation of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_10">Sections 21</a> or 22 of the

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_11">Air Act</a> would become non-est. The learned Counsel would

also draw attention to the material portion of the complaint at

Paragraph-7 of the complaint, which refers to failure to apply

for consent to the Pollution Control Board before 31.3.2003 and

also to the Ministry of Environment and Forests to obtain

environmental clearance and therefore, an offence having been

committed. The learned counsel would submit that even
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 6</span>




according to the respondent, the petitioner having commenced

their mining operations with effect from the year 2004, the

question of complying with the directions issued to obtain

consent and clearance even prior to that date, would hardly

arise and therefore, there is no substance in the complaint. It is

secondly pointed out that the authorisation to file a criminal

case for violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_12">Sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/1161070/" id="a_13">22</a> of the

Air Act, at Annexure-8 Page 27 of the memorandum, would

indicate that the primary allegation is as regards mining beyond

the permitted capacity of 7900 Metric Tonnes per annum,

whereas the present complaint was filed in respect of non-

obtaining the clearances as of 31.3.2003, which was not at all

relevant. In any event, the petitioners have obtained clearances

as at Annexure - A to the petition as on 12.9.2006 from the

Ministry of Environment and Forests.        And insofar as the

excess mining which is alleged and for which an authorization

to file a criminal case was granted, was also rendered non-est

in view of such a clearance and consent having been obtained to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                7</span>




increase its mining capacity from 7900 Metric Tonnes per

annum to 80000 Metric Tonnes per annum         and reference to

the same is at Annexure-A to the petition itself. Therefore, the

learned counsel contends that the allegations in the complaint,

even if uncontroverted, would not lead to conviction for the

offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_14">Sections 21</a> or 22 of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_15">Air Act</a> and

hence, the complaint ought to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      4.   On the other hand, the learned Counsel for the

respondent would vehemently contend that obtaining clearance

under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_16">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986       (Hereinafter

referred to as the 'EP Act', for brevity)       is a condition

precedent to commence any mining activity. This is evident

from the dictum of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_17">M.C.Mehta vs.

Union of India</a>, AIR 2004 SC 4016, wherein the Supreme

Court has, in so many words, discussed the procedure insofar

as obtaining sanction and clearances under the EP Act and this

being a mandatory requirement, the subsequent clearance or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                8</span>




permission granted to the petitioner would be redundant insofar

as its non-observance and non-compliance for the relevant

period when the mining activity had commenced in the year

2004 and therefore, the sanction and authorization granted to

initiate prosecution was not only in respect of the excess mined

quantity, but also the absence of clearance under the EP Act,

which was admittedly obtained only subsequent to the year

2006. This would not enable the petitioner to claim that its

mining activity was legal. Therefore, the learned Counsel

would submit that insofar as the contention of the petitioners

that there was no need to comply with the direction by the

Government of India that all the existing units, or expanding

their capacity, should have obtained such clearance on or

before 31.3.2003, the petitioner, if it had commenced its

activity in the year 2004, it necessarily was required to obtain

clearance even prior to commencing its activity and in the

absence of the same, is clearly an offence committed under the

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_18">Air Act</a>. The learned Counsel would submit that the offences
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 9</span>




committed are two-fold, firstly that there was no such clearance

obtained    and secondly, the petitioner had exceeded the

permissible quantity of mined ore, which admittedly was much

beyond 7900 Metric Tonnes per annum, which was permissible

under the consent order and therefore would submit that there is

adequate ground made out in the complaint for bringing home a

charge for an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1296808/" id="a_19">Section 37</a> of the Air

Act.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       5. Having regard to the above rival contentions, it is not

in dispute that the petitioner has commenced the mining

activity only in the year 2004. The clearance under the EP Act

has been obtained with effect from 12.9.2006 and insofar as

consent under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_20">Air Act</a> to mine the iron ore, even though was

restricted to 7900 Metric Tonnes per annum under the original

consent obtained, the same has been enhanced with effect from

2006 to 80000 Metric Tonnes per annum.        The activity of the

petitioner, if it was illegal, prior to obtaining such consent and

clearance, would be insignificant as the authorities could have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                10</span>




withheld such consent and clearance, if indeed the petitioner

had violated the conditions in the first instance. The respondent

claiming that it would amount to an offence and that there was

no such consent or clearance prior to the year 2006, was a

glaring circumstance, which the Government of India ought to

have taken into account in extending such clearance and

consent. Notwithstanding the mandate of the apex court in

M.C.Mehta's case, supra,        to the effect that any such

permission should have been granted before hand,          was an

aspect which ought to have been considered by the Ministry of

Environment and Forests, Government of India, which could

very well have withheld the consent and clearance. That not

having been done, it is apparent that the authorities concerned

did not find any fault with the activity of the petitioners.

Therefore, in the light of the admitted clearance and consent

granted to the petitioners subsequently, there is no indication of

the authorities having found fault with the activity of the

petitioners even prior to the date of such clearance and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                 11</span>




consent.        Accordingly, there is no substance in the

allegations made at this point of time.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      6. Further, from a plain reading of the authorization

obtained to file a complaint and the complaint itself,        it is

apparent that there is inconsistency, in that, the authorization is

in respect of the excess mined quantity of ore, whereas the

complaint is primarily as regards the failure on the part of the

petitioners in obtaining a clearance under the EP Act. This

inconsistency would also defeat the complaint as it would

apparently be without authorization . Insofar as the allegation

that there was excess mining of the ore well beyond 7800

Metric Tonnes per annum, is concerned, that again having been

permitted by the Government of India, as per Annexure-A,

would hardly leave scope for a criminal prosecution on the

alleged violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_21">Sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/1161070/" id="a_22">22</a> of the

Air Act. Therefore, there is substance in the petition seeking

quashing of the proceedings as the petitioner, as on date, is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                              12</span>




armed with necessary consent and clearance. Hence, the

criminal prosecution is not only infirm, in that, it is not

consistent with the requirement of law, but also would be a

futile exercise.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">       Therefore, the petition is allowed and the proceedings

before the Civil Judge (Junior Division) and JMFC,

Chikkanayakanahalli, in CC No.286/2007 shall stand quashed.
