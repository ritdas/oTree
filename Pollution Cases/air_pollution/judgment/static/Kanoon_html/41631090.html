CORAM:      HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE RAMESHWAR SINGH MALIK


Present:    Mr, Lalit Rishi, Advocate for
            Mr. D.S.Patwalia, Advocate
            for the petitioner.

            Mr. R.S.Bajaj, Advocate
            for respondent No.2 and 3.

                  ***
</pre>
<p id="p_1">RAMESHWAR SINGH MALIK J.(ORAL):
</p>
<p id="p_2">            The instant petition is directed against the order dated

6.1.2009, passed by the learned Sessions Court, Jalandhar, whereby

the revision petition filed by the present petitioner was dismissed on

account of delay of 3 days in filing the revision petition.

</p><p id="p_3">            The brief facts, necessary for disposing of the short

issued involved in the present case, are that the petitioner filed the

complaint under Sections 43, 44 read with <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_1">Section 47</a> of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, against the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Criminal Misc. No. M-34416 of 2009                                   2</span>

respondents herein.    The complaint No. 164/2/94 is appended as

Annexure P-1. The stand taken by the respondents was that their

firm stood closed six years prior to the alleged offence committed by

them. This stand was taken by the respondents vide Annexure P-2.

Based on the above, the petitioner-Board decided to consider the

request of the respondents for withdrawal of the complaint, which is

depicted from the communication dated 21.2.2006 (Annexure P-3).

</p><p id="p_4">           It is the further case set up by the petitioner-Board that

although the request of the respondents for withdrawal of the

complaint was under consideration but the charge had been framed

against the respondents in the complaint (Annexure P-1).            On

2.6.2006, when the case was fixed before the learned trial court of

the Judicial Magistrate, Jalandhar, nobody appeared on behalf of the

complainant and the learned trial court, while referring to the

observations made in the communication (Annexure P-3), that since

the offence was compoundable, dismissed the complaint and the

accused were ordered to be discharged. This order dated 2.6.2006

is appended as Annexure P-4.
</p>
<p id="p_5">           Dissatisfied with the above said order, petitioner-

complainant Board filed its revision petition before the learned

Sessions Judge, Jalandhar, vide Annexure P-5.          However, since

there was a delay of 3 days in filing the revision petition, the

application under     <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_3">Section   5</a> of the Limitation Act, seeking

condonation of delay of 5 days in filing the revision petition, was also

filed, vide Annexure P-6.       However, learned Sessions Judge,

Jalandhar, dismissed the application for condonation of delay and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Criminal Misc. No. M-34416 of 2009                                      3</span>

also the criminal revision petition, vide impugned order dated

6.1.2009 (Annexure P-7), observing therein that the complainant-

Board failed to give sufficient cause and reasons explaining the delay

of 3 days in filing the revision petition. Thus, the learned Sessions

Judge, Jalandhar, passed the impugned order dismissing the revision

petition, as barred by limitation without going into merits of the case.

</p><p id="p_6">              Feeling aggrieved against the above said orders,

complainant-Board as approached this Court by way of instant

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_7">              Notice of motion was issued.
</p>
<p id="p_8">              Learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently contended

that impugned order was not sustainable in law because the revision

petition before the learned Session Judge was not hopelessly time

barred. It was delayed only by three days. He further submits that

the learned Sessions Judge, Jalandhar, ought not to have dismissed

the revision petition solely because of delay of three days. Instead,

the revision petition ought to have been decided on merits of the

case.       He also contended that no prejudice, as such, has been

shown to have been caused to the respondents-accused because of

the delay of three days in filing the revision petition, nor the petitioner

was going to gain anything in delaying the matter. Since the order

(Annexure P-4) was passed by learned JMIC, Jalandhar, in the

absence of the complainant-Board, the learned Sessions Judge has

fell into serious error of law while passing the impugned order,

dismissing the revision petition only because of the delay of three

days and not deciding the same on merits.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Criminal Misc. No. M-34416 of 2009                                                   4</span><p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">               Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents submits

that the impugned order does not suffer from any illegality or

perversity. Since the petitioner-Board miserably failed to show any

cause, explaining the delay of three days in filing the revision petition,

the application under <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_4">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act was rightly

dismissed and the impugned order passed by the learned Sessions

Judge, Jalandhar was liable to be upheld.
</p>
<p id="p_11">               Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after

going through the record of the case, this Court is of the considered

opinion that present one is a fit case for exercising the inherent

jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_5">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. so as to prevent

the abuse of process of law and also to secure the ends of justice. I

say so because of more than one reasons, being recorded

hereinafter.
</p>
<p id="p_12">               It is the settled proposition of law that rules of procedure

are handmaids of justice, which are meant to be followed for

advancing the cause of justice. No doubt, the law of limitation is

indeed     an       important law on the statute book. It is in furtherance

of the sound public policy to put a quietus to disputes or

grievances of which resolution and redressal are not sought

within     the       prescribed     time.          The       law    of limitation    is

intended       to     allow   things       to     finally settle    down     after       a

reasonable          time   and      not     to     let everyone live in a state of

uncertainty. It does not permit any one to raise claims that are very

old and stale and does not allow anyone to approach the higher tiers

of   the    judicial       system    for        correction     of   the lower court's
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> Criminal Misc. No. M-34416 of 2009                                   5</span>

orders or for redressal of grievances at one's own sweet will.

However, at the same time, the Courts are also expected to proceed

with a pragmatic and liberal approach. No straight jacket formula can

be and should be laid down in this regard, leaving it open to the

Courts to decide the cases as per the peculiar fact situation

obtaining in a given case. Courts have to keep in mind the basic and

fundamental princple of law that justice is not only to be done but it

seems to have been done.
</p>
<p id="p_13">           Further,     whenever   the   technicalities   of   law   and

substantive justice are pitted against each other, it is always the

substantive justice, which is to prevail and the technicalities of law

must give way to the substantive justice.
</p>
<p id="p_14">           Keeping the aforesaid principle of law in view, this Court

is of this confirm opinion that the impugned order passed by the

learned Sessions Judge, Jalandhar, is not sustainable in law.

</p><p id="p_15">           Firstly, the delay was only of three days. It was not an old

and stale matter. Secondly, the order which was being challenged in

the revision petition before the learned Sessions Judge, had been

passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate in the absence of

the petitioner-Board.
</p>
<p id="p_16">           Thirdly, the learned Sessions Judge failed to appreciate

the ground realities of life expecting the strict explanation for each

day, from the petitioner-Board, which is a government agency. It

was not an individual who was to pursue the litigation. Before filing

the revision petition in the court of learned Sessions Judge, requisite

sanction was to be sought from the competent authority. It was so
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Criminal Misc. No. M-34416 of 2009                                   6</span>

pleaded in the application under <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_6">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act as

noted by the learned Sessions Judge in para 7 of the impugned order

that time was consumed for obtaining the sanction of the competent

authority.
</p>
<p id="p_17">             Another question that falls for consideration of this Court

would be the scope of inherent jurisdiction of this Court under

<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_7">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. No doubt, the powers under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_8">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.

are not unlimited but at the same time, there is no denying to the fact

that powers under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_9">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. are wide enough and are

meant to be exercised for preventing the abuse of process of the

Court and securing the ends of justice. It has been so settled by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in long series of judgments and the recent

one, in this regard, is State of Punjab versus Devinder Pal Singh

Bhullar, 2012 (1) RCR (criminal) 126.
</p>
<p id="p_18">             Keeping in view the totality of facts and circumstances of

the   present   case    noted   above,   coupled   with   the   reasons

aforementioned, this Court has no hesitation to conclude that the

impugned order dated 6.1.2009 (Annexure P-7), passed by learned

Sessions Judge, Jalandhar, suffers from patent illegality.

</p><p id="p_19">       Consequently, the impugned order dated 6.1.2009 (Annexure

P-7), is set aside. The application under <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_10">Section 5</a> of the Limitation

Act, moved by the petitioner, is allowed. Delay of three days in filing

the revision petition before the learned Sessions Judge, Jalandhar, is

condoned.     The matter is remitted back to the learned Sessions

Judge, Jalandhar, for deciding the revision of the petitioner Board,

afresh on merits of the case.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> Criminal Misc. No. M-34416 of 2009                                7</span><p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">           Owing to the peculiar fact situation of the present case,

learned Sessions Judge, Jalandhar, is directed to make endeavour to

decide the case at an early date, preferably within a period of three

months from the date of receipt of the copy of this order.
