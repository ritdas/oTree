             HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                      W.P. No.392/2008
   (M/s. Ravi Kant Bansal Vs. Industrial Infrastructure
            Development Corporation &amp; Ors.)

Gwalior, Dated :03.05.2018
        Shri S.S. Bansal, learned counsel for the petitioner.
        Shri Anil Sharma, learned counsel for respondent</pre>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">No. 1</span>
<p id="p_1">        Shri A.K. Nirankari, learned Govt. Advocate for
respondents No. 2, 3 and 4/State.
</p><p id="p_2">        This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner
not challenging any particular order but being aggrieved
by the action of respondent No. 1 in not extending the
lease period for want of NOC by respondent No. 3 and
the Pollution Control Board.
</p><p id="p_3">        It is petitioner's contention that petitioner is a
small scale industry having registration under the DIC
dated 12.05.1992 having its registered office at Gwalior.
According to the petitioner, work of respondent No. 1 is
to develop infrastructure facilities for establishment of
industry and accordingly petitioner after obtaining
permission had established a plant for manufacture of
hot mixed Asphalt products at Malanpur area for which
lease was executed on 20.10.1992. Land measuring
4046.86 Sq.m. was allotted and the initial period of
lease was six years i.e. it was to end on 19.10.1998 but
same has not been extended and accordingly petitioner
prays for direction to respondent No. 1 to consider the
application of the petitioner for extension of period of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                          2</span>
           HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                    W.P. No.392/2008
   (M/s. Ravi Kant Bansal Vs. Industrial Infrastructure
            Development Corporation &amp; Ors.)

lease deed and pass suitable orders and till then, it has
been prayed that respondent No. 1 be restrained not to
remove/dis-mantal petitioner's hot mixed plant by way
of any coercive process. Direction has also been sought
against respondent No. 3 to issue NOC in compliance of
the approval given by respondent No. 2.
</p><p id="p_4">       Learned counsel for respondent No. 1 on the other
hand submits that this is second round of litigation.
Earlier petitioner had filed W.P. No. 1154/2000 in which
vide order dated 07.09.2006 petition was disposed of
with liberty to the petitioner to submit no objection
certificate from Fire Station, Malanpur and clearance
from Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board within a
period of one month. It was directed that if these
documents are produced, then respondent No. 1 shall
consider the case of the petitioner for extension of lease
deed in his favour. It is further submitted that though
Pollution Control Board had renewed the permission for
a period of two years under the provisions of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Air
Pollution Control Act</a>, 1981 vide order Annexure P-3 but
application of the petitioner as was forwarded by the
Head quarters of Fire Brigade vide Annexure P-4 has
been    rejected    by   the    concerned   authority   i.e.
respondent    No.    3   vide   order   dated   07.12.2006
(Annexure P-8). It is submitted that there has been no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                         3</span>
           HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                    W.P. No.392/2008
   (M/s. Ravi Kant Bansal Vs. Industrial Infrastructure
            Development Corporation &amp; Ors.)

lapse on the part of respondent No. 1, inasmuch as
petitioner had though sent a communication Annexure
P-5 dated 27.12.2006 but had not enclosed copy of
decision under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Section 133</a> by the Court at Gohad. On
the contrary, on 06.11.2006 In-charge General Manager
had asked the petitioner to submit necessary documents
in compliance of the order of the High Court dated
07.09.2006 but such documents were not filed and
another reminder was sent on 03.02.2007 seeking copy
of NOC from Deputy Inspector General of Police, Fire
Brigade, Indore.
</p><p id="p_5">     It is also submitted by the learned counsel for
respondent No. 1 that in absence of clearance from the
Fire Brigade Department, extension of lease cannot be
granted to the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_6">     It is also submitted that in fact spot inspection
report of the authorities of the Fire Brigade Services as
are contained in Annexure R-1 points out towards the
nuisance and pollution and justifies refusal of NOC.
Similarly, order passed by SDO Revenue Gohad, dated
14.11.2006 has been filed as Annexure R-2 to point out
that in fact even SDO, Gohad, has categorically
mentioned in the order that hot mix plant be closed
immediately and removed from the rural populated area
of Malanpur and accordingly order Annexure R-3 was

           HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                    W.P. No.392/2008
   (M/s. Ravi Kant Bansal Vs. Industrial Infrastructure
            Development Corporation &amp; Ors.)

issued to the SHO, Malanpur. In view of such
submissions, he prays for dismissal of this writ petition.
</p><p id="p_7">      It is an admitted position that petitioner has not
challenged the order Annexure P-8 before this Court.
Therefore, once the respondent No. 3 has refused to
grant permission/NOC to the petitioner it cannot be said
that there is any violation of the order of the High Court
dated 15.09.2006 because condition precedent for
consideration of petitioner's case for extension of lease
deed was NOC from Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control
Board and NOC from Fire Station Malanpur. As there is
no NOC from Fire Station Malanpur, merely forwarding
of a communication by the Inspector General of Police
to the competent authority will not entitle the petitioner
to claim any relief for extension of lease deed in his
favour.
</p><p id="p_8">      It is also seen that petitioner has misrepresented
the facts in the writ petition. It is apparent from
Annexure P-5 that the order under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Section 133</a> was
never filed from the competent Court, on the other hand
SDO had not entertained the plea of the petitioner in
regard to continuance of hot mixed plant on the finding
recorded by it that such hot mixed plaint was not only
causing environmental pollution but also was a source of
nuisance which required to be removed immediately

                  from the Abadi area.
</p><p id="p_9">                         In view of such facts, no directions can be issued
                  against respondent No. 1 for renewal of the lease. Thus,
                  the petition fails and is dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
