2.           Case of the workmen :-          Workmen contend that they

</pre><p id="p_5">were working with the management upto the mark and there was no

complaint. The workmen were not given the legal benefits. Names of

20 workmen were not entered into the registers.              Therefore, they

made     a   complaint    to   the   Assistant   Labour    Commissioner    on

24.07.2001,     so that the names of 20 workmen are taken into the

register.
</p>
<p id="p_6">3.           On 25.07.2001, the workmen were not allowed to enter


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                          3/28</span>
 into the factory and they were refused their duties by the management

since the management was green eyed over the workmen for the

complaint. Further, the management threatened the workmen that if

they insisted to enter into the factory, they would be facing dire

consequences. The workmen informed the Union leader of Krantikari

General Mazdoor Union.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.          On the same day along with leader at 3 p.m., the workmen

went to Samaipur Badli Police Station.          The SHO and the SI

manhandled the Union leaders, while the workmen were outside the

police station. The management in connivance with the police coerced

the workmen and the Union leaders to sign certain papers to fabricate

that there has been no dispute. The same was immediately informed

to various authorities. The matter was brought to the notice of the

labour department. The management refused to take them back on

duties. The workmen contended that all of them were removed illegally

and unjustifiably from the duties w.e.f. 25.07.2001. The management

had resorted to unfair labour practice and victimisation.               The

management has not followed <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_1">Section 25-F</a> of the ID Act. There was

no misconduct by any of the workmen and no enquiry was held. The

termination of the workmen is illegal.    Therefore, the workmen had

sought for reinstatement with full back wages and cost of litigation.

Kanta Prasad was harassing the management, extorting the money

from the management for the past four years and was collecting Rs.

3,500/- per month.    On 25.07.2001, Kanta Prasad demanded Rs.

10,000/- per month to allow the factory to run and threatened the

director of the management with dire consequences. The allegations

in the claim statement are all denied. All the workmen on 25.07.2001,

have abstained from duties at the behest of Kanta Prasad. The said

person with 6 to 7 persons armed with iron rods had assaulted the

director, squatted on the factory gate and threatened that unless the

management pays the amount of Rs. 10,000/- per month, he would not

allow the management to run the factory. The management informed

the police who shifted them to the police station. The management

denies that Union leader was beaten up by the SHO and the SI and

further denies that no coercion was brought on the workers to sign the

blank papers. The management was following all the labour statutes.

employer employee relationship between the management number 2

Babu Ram and Ram Bilas. The other workmen deserted the work since

relief and the management seeks for dismissal of the claim.

answer the issues as under.
</p>
<p id="p_27">13.            ISSUE NUMBER 1 :           This issue concerns the abdication

of duties and absence of the workmen from duties w.e.f. 25.07.2001.

The onus to prove this issue is on the management.                    Management

contended that workmen Rajender, Radhey Shyam, Ram Kailash,

Suresh Yadav, Naresh, Sohan Lal, Naveen, Shankar Singh, Bhola Singh,

Balister Singh, Anil Mishra, Ganesh Mishra, Dinesh, Arjun, Jai Prakash,

Lal Dev, Vasu Pal, Ashok Kumar, Sita Ram, Satpal Singh, Umesh

Umesh Kumar (WW 5), Udai Kumar (WW 6), Ram Kailash (WW 7),

Shankar Singh (WW 8), Ganesh Mishra (WW 9), Ashok Kumar (WW 10),

Upender (WW 11-not concerning issue number 1), Sohan Lal (WW 12),

Satpal Singh (WW 13), Ram Vinay Sharma (WW 14) are examined on

behalf of the workmen. Except Upender (WW 11), all the other

workmen examined are alleged to have remained absent w.e.f.

25.07.2001, despite notices.    The case of the management in the

written arguments also is that the management has been constantly

advising the absentee workers to resume the duties through several

letters, sent to the Labour department and also as urged in the

pleadings before the conciliation officer. The management did not

terminate the services of these employees. The management did not

obstruct them from joining the duties.
</p>
<p id="p_29">15.         I have perused the evidence recorded in this case.       The

evidence of all the workmen are identical and stereo type. They have

filed their affidavits. In the evidence of Abhilakh, WW 1 which is at Ex.

WW 1/A, he claims having worked for 10 years. It is his contention that

on 25.07.2001, the management did not allow him into the factory. All

the other workmen examined in this case in their affidavits have

similarly stated so in para 4 of their affidavits. The onus on issue


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                   11/28</span>
 number 1 being on management number 1, examined MW 1. MW 1 in

his affidavit at Ex. MW 1/A deposed that the workmen were not

terminated on 25.07.2001. In fact on 25.07.2001, there was a strike.

At para 15 of the affidavit, he deposes that the workmen were asked to

join the duties by a letter dated 26.07.2001, Ex. MW 1/6 directing all

the workmen to resume their duties. Ex. MW 1/6 is produced on record.

This is addressed to 31 who are all covered under issue number 1. The

said letter is issued at the C/o address of the Union. In the said letter,

it is demanded by the authorised signatory of the management

number 2 asking the workmen to join the duties. Ex. MW 1/7 is the

postal receipt.   Ex. MW 1/8 is the letter addressed to the Labour

Commissioner informing them that the workmen have stopped

reporting to come to the duties and the indulgence of the Labour

Commissioner is sought. The same is bearing the seal of the office of

the Labour Commissioner. Ex. MW 1/11 dated 14.08.2001, it is stated

that the absentee workers had refused to receive the wages.           The

same is addressed to the Labour Commissioner. While cross-examining

MW 1, the workmen got elicited that the management has no record to

prove that the Union leaders were collecting the money from the

management. He also admits that the Labour Inspector had lodged a

criminal complaint against the management. MW 1 also admits that an


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                    12/28</span>
 accident took place in the month of November, 2007 and one workman

by name Om Prakash, sustained injuries.      As regards the present

workmen, witness admits that the management has not conducted any

enquiry with regard to the unauthorised absence. MW 1 is the director

of the management number 2. This witness denies a suggestion that

the management had not offered employment to the workmen before

any authority.
</p>
<p id="p_30">16.        From the documentary evidence produced by the MW 1,

apart from the joint letter addressed to the workmen at the address of

the Union, the management had also issued separate notices to the

workman which are addressed to all the workmen, at the union

address. MW 1 in his affidavit at para 33 deposed that he sent a

charge sheet dated 09.12.2004, at Ex. MW 1/57 to each individual

worker vide postal receipts Ex. MW 1/58 to 1/70 seeking an

explanation for unauthorised absence. I have perused Ex. MW 1/57.

This is a joint charge sheet issued against all the workmen and the

postal receipts are also produced bearing the date as 09.12.2004.

However, I find that Ex. MW 1/21, before the conciliation Officer S.P.

Singh, the management addressed a letter to the said authority asking

the labour department to persuade the workmen to resume the duties.

Ex. MW 1/22 and 23 are the postal receipts. Likewise, in the pleadings


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                13/28</span>
 before the conciliation officer at Ex. MW 1/23A, the management had

also sought for the workmen to join the duties which was sent by a

registered post. Ex. MW 1/27 is the written statement filed by the

management before the conciliation officer wherein it is reiterated that

the absentee workers did not resume their duty and that their services

were not terminated. The same is dated NIL. I also find that Ex. MW

1/39 dated 09.01.2002, Ex. MW 1/41 dated 24.09.2002, Ex. MW 1/43

dated 27.12.2002, Ex. MW 1/45 dated 15.02.2003, Ex. MW 1/47 dated

24.05.2003, Ex. MW 1/49 dated 15.03.2004, Ex. MW 1/51 dated

27.12.2003, Ex. MW 1/53 dated 18.09.2003, Ex. MW 1/55             dated

18.06.2004, Ex. MW 1/57 dated 09.12.2004 are all addressed to the

workmen in issue number 1 at their C/o address of the Union asking

them to resume the duties immediately. These letters are supported

by the postal receipts sent individually also to the workmen at Ex. MW

1/58 to 69.     The workmen had not cross-examined MW 1 on these

documents.
</p>
<p id="p_31">17.           At the same time, it is to be seen that the management's

responsibility does not cease by writing a letter addressed to the

Union.   Under what circumstances, these letters have not been

individually addressed to the workmen at their residences is not

forthcoming.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                  14/28</span>
</p><p id="p_33">            The management having not sent the letters and the

charge sheet to the workmen at their residential address, the charge

sheet can not be treated as the service on each individual workman,

since it is addressed at the C/o address of the Union.      The effect of

such improper service is dealt while answering issue number 5.

However, it is clear from the documentary evidence that the workmen

have not attended the duties from 25.07.2001, despite messages. The

effect of the same and the attendant circumstances are dealt in the

succeeding part herein while the answering to issue number 5. Thus,

issue number 1 is answered accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_34">18.        ISSUE NUMBER 2 :      In    this   issue,   I   am   to   answer

whether there exists the relationship of employer and employee

between the management and the workmen Shiv Pujan, Ranjan,

Upender, Baboo Ram, Rajesh, Ram Bilas and Rajesh Yadav.              Out of

these workmen, except Upender S/o Balram Prasad, no other workmen

is examined. Upender is examined as WW 11. In his affidavit at Ex.

WW 11/A, he had deposed that he had been working with the

management for the past 9 years.      He relied on two documents Ex.

WW 11/1, the ESI card and Ex. WW 11/2 the postal correspondence. In

the cross-examination, he admits that the ESI card is issued by M/s

Okay Engineering where he was working. He also admits that he never


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                                      15/28</span>
 worked with the managements 1 and 2.         Therefore, the case of the

workmen Upender S/o Balram Prasad, nowhere stands.          WW 11 had

utterly failed to establish the relationship. Likewise, the other workmen

Shiv Pujan, Ranjan, Baboo Ram, Rajesh, Ram Bilas and Rajesh Yadav,

having not led any evidence, they can not be held as employees of the

management numbers 1 and 2.            Thus, issue number 2 stands

answered in favour of the management and against the workmen.

</p><p id="p_35">19.         ISSUE NUMBER 3 :        The management having contended

that the workmen Bhola Singh, Harender, Navin, Arjun Singh, Dinesh,

Rajender, Master Radhey Shyam, Suresh Yadav and Sita Ram, have

settled their matters amicably with the management is required to

prove the same and the onus is on the management. I have perused

the evidence of MW 1. This witness in his affidavit at Ex. MW 1/A had

stated that the above names workers have settled their disputes with

the managements. The true copies of the settlements are at Ex. MW

1/77 to 1/82. I perused the document at Ex. MW 1/72, this is a letter

addressed to the Labour Commissioner dated 15.07.2006, copies of

which were marked to ESIC, PF Commissioners and the Inspector of

Factories. The postal receipts are at Exs. MW 1/73 to 76. Ex. MW 1/77

is the settlement deed between workman Navin and the management

number 2. There is a receipt of Rs. 20,000/- towards full and final


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                                   16/28</span>
 settlement. It is the settlement U/s 18(1) of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_6">Industrial Disputes Act</a>.

Ex. MW 1/78 is the settlement entered with Harender, for a sum of Rs.

17,000/-. Ex. MW 1/79 is the settlement entered with Rajender for a

sum of Rs. 20,000/-. Ex. MW 1/80 is the settlement entered with

Suresh Yadav, for a sum of Rs. 16,000/-. Ex. MW 1/81 is the settlement

entered with Radhey Shyam, for a sum of Rs. 20,000/-. Ex. MW 1/82 is

the settlement entered with Dinesh Prasad, for a sum of Rs. 20,000/-.

Ex. MW 1/83 is the settlement entered with Sita Ram, for a total sum

not mentioned but as having paid bonus and leave wages.           Ex. MW

1/84 is the settlement entered with Arjun Kumar Singh, for a sum of

Rs. 18,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_36">20.         Out of these workmen, no one had come into the witness

box to controvert the say of MW 1.         They remained unexamined.

However, I have perused the evidence of MW 1 who was cross-

examined at length. A suggestion was made to the witness that no

payments were done before the Labour Inspector which was denied by

the witness. In the absence of the denial by the each individual

workmen against whom the management contends that there was a

settlement, it becomes difficult to disbelieve the statement of MW 1

and the documentary evidence produced by MW 1. It was argued by

the workmen that the management have fabricated the documents. I

 see no sound logic to hold that the documents are fabricated by the

management. Hence, issue number 3 is held in favour of the

management and against the workmen.
</p>
<p id="p_37">21.        ISSUE NUMBER 4 :       The management in its amended

written statement had contended at para 3 of the preliminary

objections that M/s Rodex Rubbery Factory had changed its name and

constitution as M/s Black Stone Automobiles Pvt. Ltd. In the rejoinder,

the workman denied this fact for want of knowledge. They contend

that it is an unfair labour practice on the part of the management.

While signing the written statement also, the Director had mentioned

that the Black Stone Automobiles Pvt. Ltd. was formerly known as M/s

Rodex Rubber Factory. Apart from the pleadings, the      management

has not led any evidence by producing the certificate of incorporation

or the resolutions of the earlier company.       Hence, this issue is

answered in the negative. The effect of the same would be discussed

in the succeeding issue.
</p>
<p id="p_38">22.        ISSUE NUMBER 5 :       From the discussion at issue number

1 and issue number 2 all the workmen examined except Upender,

being the employees of management number 2 have not attended the

remained absent is to be looked from the pleadings and the evidence

 led. MW 1 in his evidence concedes that there was an accident in the

factory during November, 2007 in which one worker Om Prakash, was

injured.   MW 1 also admits that the Labour Inspector had lodged a

criminal complaint against the management and the matter is pending

before the Ld. MM.
</p>
<p id="p_39">23.           From the written arguments filed by the management, it is

rightly suggested that 'a question would arise as why a workman would

raise an industrial dispute if he had voluntarily left the services and still

make a claim.      The management argues that the matter is to be

looked from the Union activities and the attitude of some of the union

leaders who would catch hold of some workmen and make illegal

demands.
</p>
<p id="p_40">24.           The question posed by the management is not only to be

looked into from the points suggested but also from the pleadings. It is

from the pleadings that one can make out that there was some

altercation    between   the   union   leaders    and   the   management

concerning 20 workers having not been reflected in the registers and

the workmen were not allowed inside the factory on 25.07.2001. The

evidence of workmen are alike in this aspect.        WW 1 had produced

certain documents which are Mark A to Mark T. Only the photocopies

of these documents are produced on record. They are not proved on


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                      19/28</span>
 record.   From the cross-examination of MW 1 which I have already

discussed at the cost of repetition, it is to be stated that MW 1 admits

having not produced the appointment letter of any of the employee.

MW 1 also admitted that he has no records to prove that the union

leaders were demanding from the management. MW 1 further admits

that the labour Inspector had lodged a criminal complaint against the

management.      It is also forthcoming that one worker was injured in

November, 2007 and that there was no enquiry, which is nothing to do

with the present case.    From the evidence of MW 1 who admits as

mentioned above, it is clear that there were some discrepancies in

keeping the registers of the workmen and issuing the proper

appointment letters. This must have led to the collective bargaining by

the employees. There is no evidence that the union leader was being

paid any ransom to buy peace. Therefore, it is clear that the workmen

struck the work.   No doubt the conciliation had taken place, which

failed.
</p>
<p id="p_41">25.         It is also clear from the evidence that the workmen did not

report to the duties.    The management relied on Tejpal vs. Gopal

Narain LLR 2006 P. 1142 Del. to urge that declining relief to the

workman alleging illegal termination but not reporting duty is justified.

Reliance is also placed on the point by urging the ruling of <a href="/doc/1728232/" id="a_7">Sonal

the rule of Competition Printing Press vs. Shriut Jai Prakash

Singh LLR 2001 P. 768 Bom. These are all the rulings where the

workman had willfully absented despite repeated communication. In

the instant case as discussed by me at issue number 1, the

management had not sent the individual communications at the

residential addresses of the workmen. The case of the workmen is to

be understood who were making collective bargaining through the

Union.    The management had served the notices only on the Union.

For making collective bargaining, the process involves considerable

length of time, by which time it can not be expected that all the

workmen will be in constant touch with the Union so as to respond to

the notices issued by the management. The non-issuance of the

notices at the residential addresses and issue of notice only through

the Union can not be treated as a proper service of communication.

Therefore, the rulings urged by the management are distinguishable

on facts.   Viewed from this point, the notices can not be treated as

proper service and therefore, the workmen who had expectations in

the collective bargaining expected some settlement which could not

emerge.     Their absence from duties is thus to be understood, since

management clearly admits that there was a strike on 25.07.2001.

</p><p id="p_42"> 26.         Though there is no termination even today on record, in

the wake of the circumstances whereby the workmen did not attend

the duties, the termination can not be termed illegal or unjustified

since there is no such termination on record.
</p>
<p id="p_43">27.         As there is no termination, now I am to see whether the

workmen can be directed to be reinstated into service.        In the written

statement, at para 5 of the preliminary objections, it is stated that the

management       closed   down   its   activities   from   01.06.2006    and

disconnection of power. The same is testified at para 38 of Ex. MW 1/A.

The workmen cross-examined MW 1 and got elicited that there was an

accident in the factory. Thus, the workmen argued that the factory is

still in existence. The management argued that this was a stranded

incident in which the accident occurred while removing the machinery

after closure.

<p id="p_44">28.         The management relied on <a href="/doc/483962/" id="a_8">J. K. Hosiery Factory vs.

Labour Appellate Tribunal</a> AIR 1956 ALL P. 498 to urge that if a

person is compelled to carry on a particular trade or business, it affects

his right to carry on any other trade or business and that no person can

be debarred from disposing his property or from practicing any

profession. Further, reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/632091/" id="a_9">Workmen of Indian Leaf

Tobaccoo Co. vs. Management of Indian Leaf Tobacco Co</a>. AIR

 1970 SC 860 to urge that even a reference U/s 10(d) of the Act, can

interfere with the discretion exercised by the company in closing down

its business. No court has power to issue orders to the company to

reopen the closed business. Further it was urged that the ruling in the

matter   of   <a href="/doc/1485989/" id="a_10">Indian   Metal    and   Metallurgical      Corporation      vs.

Industrial Tribunal</a> AIR 1953 Mad. 98 on the same point.

</p><p id="p_45">29.           In the instant case, it is brought on evidence by the

management that the management closed its business in the affidavit

of MW 1. I have perused the cross-examination of MW 2. There is no

suggestion that the factory is still running. On the other hand, WW 4

and WW 5 in the cross-examination admits that the factory of the

management is        closed at present.        WW 1 and 2 in their cross-

examination by the management do not know if the factory of the

management is closed w.e.f. 01.06.2006. From the evidence, I have

no hesitation to conclude that the factory is closed down w.e.f.

01.06.2006     as   admitted   by   one   of    the   workmen.   Hence,   no

reinstatement is possible with respect to both the managements as

they are one and the same as pleaded by the workmen. Hence, the

findings on issue number 4 has no bearing in this aspect.

</p><p id="p_46">30.           There being no chance of ordering reinstatement, I will

have to find out the compensation payable to each of the workmen.
