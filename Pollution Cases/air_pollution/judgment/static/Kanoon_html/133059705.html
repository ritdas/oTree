                               JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                 Dated this the 14th day of February, 2020

S. Manikumar, CJ

      Challenging the judgment made in W.P(C). No.19575 of 2019

dated 26.9.2019, instant appeal is filed.

</p><p id="p_2">      2. The short facts leading to filing of writ petition No.19575 of

2019 are :
</p>
<p id="p_3">Petitioner is a retired Secretary from a co-operative society. Husband

of the petitioner and their only son are working abroad. Petitioner and

her husband are the joint owners of the property situated in Re-Sy.

No.431/19-5, 431/19-2 and 431/19-3, block 22 of Kolpuram Panchayat,

Kolpuram Village.     The property of the petitioner is lying in between

the Panchayat road and a large stretch of paddy field.               The

respondents are constructing a new canal having a length of 260

meters along the border of the Panchayat road touching the boundary

of the petitioner and other residents. The canal is constructed with no

open ends in a closed manner and that there will be no provision for

outflow of water or other effluents which gets accumulated in it. The

adjacent property owners are not willing to give a cut across their

property to the paddy field lying behind for outflow of water from canal.

The respondents ended the construction of the canal near to the

property of the petitioner. The petitioner's property is the lowest lying

area. As a result, water and other effluents will get accumulated in the
   W.A.166/2020
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   4</span>

canal and will get discharged into the property of the petitioner before

flowing into the paddy field. This will ultimately ruin the crops in the

property of petitioner and will cause soil erosion. Besides, the closed

end canal will cause the effluents to stagnate, raising health concerns.

There is a small opening from the canal/road in between the property

of two local residents or the canal is to be extended up to an existing

canal situated a few meters from the point where the canal now ends.

However, respondents are not willing to make use of the said existing

opening lying, in between the property of two other residents.

</p><p id="p_4">      3. A statement has been filed by the first respondent Grama

Panchayat, which inter aila states that:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "2. The Panchayat is doing the renovation of road

            starting from Palamparambil Padi to Thazhampal Padi

            having a length of 3.450 Kms. During rainy season one

            kilometer stretch of the said road starting from

            Palamparambil would be water logged causing serious

            damage to the road. During the flood of last year the

            road was almost destroyed in that area. It was because

            of this reason, the Panchayat had decided to renovate

            the road before the monsoon season. The 1st phase of

            the work has already been completed. During the 2 nd

            phase, it was decided to divert the stagnated water on
 W.A.166/2020
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 5</span>

          the road to a culvert situated nearby. Hence, a small

          channel along the length of the road was constructed for

          about 260m. Now the re-tarring work of the road is in

          progress. The rain water in the area during monsoon

          season, after flowing through this culvert would naturally

          reach the nearby paddy field. That was how it has

          been working.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                3.    It is learned that the petitioner had

          unauthorisedly blocked the natural exit of the culvert to

          the paddy fields by filling waste materials including mud

          and soil and as a result, now water is not flowing to the

          paddy field as before.     The entire area around the

          culvert is classified as paddy fields in the revenue

          records.   This is evident from Ex.P2 itself.          The

          petitioner had reclaimed her land       by filling earth by

          which the natural lie of the property was changed.

          Those illegal filling of earth had caused blockage to the

          flowing water through the culvert to the paddy fields. As

          a result now, water is being stagnated in the road. The

          problems became worse during the unprecedented

          floods happened in the previous year.</blockquote><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">                4. At present the Panchayat estimates at least
 W.A.166/2020
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     6</span>

          Rs.50        Lakhs   for   the   renovation   including   the

          construction of canal, re-tarring of road and its allied

          works.       The apprehension of the petitioner that the

          waste liquid and semi solid wastes from the nearby

          houses will enter to the paddy field is baseless. The

          canal is constructed using Irish technology which allows

          only the rain water to enter this canal and to reach the

          culvert. The alternative way suggested by the petitioner

          is not practical and there is no sanction also for the

          same. Moreover it will create additional financial burden

          to the Panchayat and also inconvenience to many local

          residents. The petitioner is the only person who has

          objected to the construction of the said canal and

          diversion of water which is based on his mere

          apprehensions.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                  5.    The apprehension of the petitioner that the

          residents of the locality will use the drainage for

          discharging filth etc. is not correct. The purpose of the

          construction itself is only to drain the stagnated rain

          water of that locality. The question of closing both ends

          of the canal as apprehended in Paragraph 13 is not at

          all arising in this case. The one side of drainage will
   W.A.166/2020
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   7</span>

            collect rain water and it will be discharged through the

            other side.     The other contentions are all mere

            apprehensions of the petitioner."
</p>
<p id="p_8">      4. A reply affidavit has been filed by the petitioner, which is as

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">            "3.   All the averments and allegations in the said

            statement filed by the 1st respondent is denied except

            to the extent specifically admitted hereunder:

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                  4.      The averments in paragraph 2 of the

            statement that rain water used to stagnate in the road is

            denied.    The canal under construction starts at the

            highest lying end of the road and ends near           the

            property of the petitioner, which is the lowest lying part

            of the road. The entire length of road which is the issue

            herein is lying in a slanting angle. Because of the slop

            of the road, water never gets stagnated on the road but

            if the canal is completed water will overflow near to the

            property of petitioners ultimately damaging/destroying

            the property of the petitioner. The averments in this

            regard is false and hence denied. It is submitted in the

            month of August 2018, the water level in the area rose

            up to the height of a two storied building.       So the
 W.A.166/2020
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 8</span>

          reference to the last years flood is unwarranted and

          misleading.</blockquote><p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">                5. The petitioner purchased the property covered

          by Ext.P1 in 2004. Since then she has not reclaimed

          any portion of the property or has changed the lie of the

          property. In the property even trees having an age of

          50 years still grows. The entire houses situated on the

          western side of the road is low lying hence houses are

          erected on pillars. The reference to the culvert is also

          denied. A culvert is constructed for a free flow of water

          across road. If the contention of the 1st respondent is

          taken into account, on either side of the road a

          thodu/canal should exist or on either side of the road

          low lying water logged properties should exist. Here the

          property on eastern side of the road is a high land and

          the property of the petitioner on western side is also

          high land. So the question of the existence of culvert or

          its blocking by the petitioner is imaginary, false and

          hence denied. It is mandatory for every panchayat to

          maintain an Asthi Register, which is a record of roads,

          canals, culvert, drain etc. vested in panchayat to show

          the existence of these. Hence the respondent may be
 W.A.166/2020
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   9</span>

          directed to produce the Asthi register to show the

          existence of canal, drain or culvert near the property

          covered by Exhibit P1.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                6. There is already provision for cut flow of water

          from canal or road as can be seen from Ext.P5 which

          can be made use of or in the alternative there is already

          a free flowing thodu across the road, a few meters away

          near from the property of the petitioner, if the road is

          extended up to that point which can also be contained

          within the present budget, whole issues can be settled.

          It is uncertain how a canal running along the line of the

          load can collect entire rain water. The said averment is

          also false. Other local residents are silent as they are

          not on the receiving end of the misdeed of the

          panchayat.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                7.   If the attempt of the respondent No.1 is

          materialized, this will cut petitioner's property into two

          making it worthless. The paddy filed lying behind the

          petitioner's property belongs to a private party, as

          learned who is currently in north India. The respondent

          No.1 is not supposed to discharge water into a private

          property on that ground as well. Hence the averments
   W.A.166/2020
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                         10</span>

             in the statement filed by the 1 st respondent are liable to

             be rejected."
</p>
<p id="p_13">        5. After considering the rival submissions, the writ court ordered

thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                 "2. Smt.Dhanya.P. Ashokan-learned Standing Counsel
                 appearing for the Panchayat, submits that the allegations of
                 the petitioner are completely untrue, because all that the
                 Panchayat is now doing is to create a water drain on the
                 side of the road, so that it will not be destroyed during the
                 monsoons and further that the water is flowing through it
                 only as it has been done for the last several decades,
                 following its natural course. She says that there is already a
                 culvert just ahead of the petitioner's property, through which
                 rain water was always flowing to the lands below and that
                 the petitioner appears to have blocked the culvert,
                 presumably to illegally convert his property which is
                 originally a paddy field. She says that the attempt of the
                 petitioner by filing this writ petition is to ensure that no water
                 flows into his property as was happening in the past,
                 because this is the normal and natural direction of its flow
                 and therefore, that this writ petition be dismissed without
                 any further orders.</blockquote><p id="p_14">

                 respondent-Pollution Control Board-Sri.T.Naveen, submits
                 that they have not been approached by the Panchayat for
                 any consent to make construction and he says that, prima
                 facie, it does not appear to be necessary either, since all
                 that thePanchayat appears to be doing is to construct a
                 canal to drain away rain water. He says that the Pollution

               this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">               4. I have considered the afore submissions and I have also
               examined the materials and pleadings on record. As is
               indubitable from the afore narration, the internecine
               disputes between the parties are in the realm of facts and it
               will not be normally possible for this Court to make
               affirmative declarations on the same. However, what is
               pertinent in this case is that the Panchayat maintains that
               they are only creating a water drain on the side of the public
               road, so as to aid the natural water flow, as was happening
               in the decades past; while the petitioner alleges that a new
               drain is being created with the specific intent of draining
               water into her property. She also has a case that there is a
               public canal nearly 100 meters away, to which the new
               canal can be connected, so that the unnecessary flooding
               of her property can be avoided.

<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">               5. On hearing the petitioner as above, I asked the learned
               Standing Counsel for the Panchayat-Smt.Dhanya P.
               Ashokan, whether the afore suggestion of the petitioner
               can be acceded, to which she submitted that it will not be
               possible because, for such an arrangement, more than 50
               lakhs will have to be expended, which the Panchayat does
               not have. Obviously, therefore, this is not an issue that this
               court can conclusively declare or direct, while acting under
               <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.

               In the afore circumstances, since the issues presented in
               this case are squarely the realm of facts, I deem it
               appropriate to close this writ petition; however, leaving
               liberty to the petitioner to either invoke alternative remedies
   W.A.166/2020

                 as are available to her under the civil law or to approach the
                 respondents with a request to have the new drain
                 connected to the public canal so that the same can be
                 considered by the competent Authorities as per law and
                 taking into account, the fiscal obligations."

           The said issue was not properly considered by learned

<p id="p_23">      4. The finding of learned Single Judge that the petitioner can

           invoke alternative remedies as are available under the civil

           law is prima facie wrong since e issue raised b the appellant

           herein is not really of civil nature by the act of the

           respondent 1 to 3 is infringing the right of the appellant

           guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_4">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.

           The learned Single Judge had ignored this fact and

           replaced it with its own opinion without any cogent

           reasoning.    Hence the judgment of the learned Single

           Judge is liable to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_24">      5. The Single Judge ought to have found that the action of

           construction of new canal without any effective drainage is

           in violation of Section 25 of the Travancore Cochin Public

           Health Act 1955 which says "every urban and local authority

           shall so far as the funds as its disposal may permit provide

           and maintain sufficient and satisfying system of public

           drains for the effectual draining of its local area.

we are of the view that, complex fact situations are involved in the

case, and the issue cannot be sorted out in a summary proceedings

under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. It was accordingly that

the learned Single Judge refused to grant the relief sought. Therefore,

such a course adopted by the learned Single Judge cannot be said to

be bad or illegal. Moreover the learned Single Judge has already

granted liberty to the petitioner to either invoke alternative remedies

available to her under the civil law or to approach the respondents with

a request to have the new drain connected to the public canal so that

the same can be considered by the competent Authorities as per law

and taking into account, the fiscal obligations. We see no reason to

interfere with the impugned judgment.
