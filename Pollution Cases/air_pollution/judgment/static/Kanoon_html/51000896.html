Suit No.08/13/08
                                   Viredner Aggarwal  Vs. Sagheer Ahmed &amp; Ors.


ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">1.    By this order I will dispose of application of plaintiff moved under Order 11 
rule 2 &amp; 14 of  CPC with the prayer for production of documents i.e inspection 
report  dated  03.10.2005  and  letter  dated  11.08.2005  as per the  pleadings  of 
defendant no.5 in WS. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.    It is stated  in the application  that in the present  suit, defendant  no.5 i.e 
Delhi Pollution Control Committee had filed its WS on 27.04.2006 and in para 5 
of the WS on merits, it is pleaded that "after inspecting M/s Star Scissors, on 
03.10.2005,   department   of   industries   has   been   requested   by   answering 
defendant (defendant no.5) to take necessary action against the industrial unit 
on 08.11.2005. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.    It is stated  in the  application  that  in the  WS  of  defendant  no.5  there  is 
reference regarding two reports of inspection however, copy of the reports were 
not placed on record alongwith the WS of defendant no.5. It is thus prayed that 
defendant no.5 may be given directions to produce aforesaid two reports. It is 
however stated that plaintiff has obtained the inspection report dated 03.10.2005 
under <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_1">RTI Act</a> 2005 and copy of the same has been placed on judicial record as 
Mark A. By the present application plaintiff also seeks reply to the interrogatory 
as :­
      "please verify the inspection report dated 03.10.2005 which is already on 
the record with their original record and reply in yes or no". 
</p><p id="p_4">4.    It   is   further   stated   in   the   application   that   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   in 
Margadia Sequeria Fernandes &amp; Ors. Vs Erasno Jack Sequeria, 2012 III AD 
(Supreme Court) 541  has held that interrogatory should be filed frequently to 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                             2</span>

detect the truth from the party. Therefore, present application has been moved. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.     Before   deciding   the   above   said   application   it   would   be   appropriate   to 
precisely mention the background of the matter. It was in year 2006 present suit 
was   filed   by   plaintiff   seeking   decree   of   permanent   and   mandatory   injunction 
against defendants Sagheer Ahmed, Zahir Ahmed (defendant no.1 and 2), MCD 
is defendant no.3, DDA is defendant no.4 and Delhi Pollution Control Committee 
is defendant no.5. It is stated that plaintiff being owner of house no.364, Hansa 
Puri   Road,   Tri   Nagar,   Delhi   and   defendant   is   tenant   in   respect   of   one   shop 
measuring 7 x 9 feet in the portion of the above said property and defendant 
no.1 and 2 store liquid and non liquid chemical in the said tenanted premises 
without having any license under DMC Act moreover, it is alleged that defendant 
no.1 and 2 are running workshop of sharping scissors through stone grinder in 
the said tenanted  shop for many  years whereas,  as per the policy and zonal 
plan of DDA, Tri Nagar, Delhi area is a residential colony and no industrial is 
permitted   in   this   area.   While   alleging   various   other   facts   it   is   prayed   that 
defendant no.1 and 2 be restrained from running any factory / workshop in the 
above said shop except by obtaining a license under DMC Act and it is prayed 
by mandatory injunction to direct defendant no.3 to close the said factory and 
also to direct to defendant  no.5 to take appropriate action against defendants 
no.1 and  2 under  the provisions  of Air and  Water  (Prevention  and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control  of 
Pollution Act</a> and under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment Act</a>).
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.    It appears from the record that defendants have filed the WS and on the 
basis of pleadings, interim injunction of the plaintiff was dismissed and issues 
were settled vide order dated 30.10.2009. Thereafter,  matter remained pending 
for recording PE up till 19.08.2013.  Thereafter, matter was fixed for recording 
DE and on behalf of defendant no.1 and 2, one witness D­1D­1 was examined, 
on behalf of DDA no evidence was led. In the course of trial counsel for MCD 
and Delhi Pollution Control Committee have stopped appearing.
</p> 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                             3</span>

<p id="p_7">7.    It   is   at   this   stage,   present   application   has   been   moved.   Copy   of   the 
application   was   supplied   to   defendant   no.1   and   2   and   defendant   no.4   and 
application   has   been   opposed   being   moved   belatedly   only   to   prolonge   the 
matter.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.    On the other hand Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff submits that in view of the 
judgment   in   Maria   Margadia's   Case   (Supra)   plaintiff   can   at   any   stage,   move 
application for interrogatory by invoking the provision of <a href="/doc/40836587/" id="a_4">Section 30</a> and Order 
11 CPC. Ld. Counsel has also relied upon judgments of Hon'ble High Court of 
Delhi in <a href="/doc/1906992/" id="a_5">A.K. Aggarwal vs Shanti Devi</a> 1996 RLR 60, Jagson International vs 
Raghunandan Saran 2002 RLR (Note) 49.
</p>

<p id="p_9">9.     Having   heard   the   submissions   at   bar   and   having   given   thoughtful 
consideration   to   the   prayer   made   in   the   present   application,   it   is   clear   that 
plaintiff is seeking interrogatory and discovery of documents. Order 11 of Code 
of Civil Procedure allows interrogatories to be administered in writing by either 
party to suit with permission of court to opposite party.   "Discovery" means to 
compel the opposite party to disclose what he has in his possession or power.  
</p><p id="p_10">       Reading the Order 11 CPC will make it clear that when after settlement of 
issues, a party to a suit may require information from his adversary as to facts or 
as to documents in possession or power of such party, relevant to the issue in 
the suit.  Where information as to facts is required, the party is allowed to put a 
series   of   questions   to   his   adversary.   These   questions   are   called 
interrogatories.   The judge will go through the proposed questions and, if he 
considers them proper, will compel the other side to answer them on oath before 
trial.  On the other hand, if information as to documents is required, a party may 
apply   for   an   order   compelling   the   other   party   to   submit   a   list   of   relevant 
documents   in   his   possession   or   power,   and,   in   certain   circumstances,   for 
permission   to   inspect   and   take   copies   of   those   documents,   which   is   called 
"discovery of documents".
</p><p id="p_11">            Rule   2   of   Order   11   of   Code   of   Civil   Procedure   provides   that   on   an 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                             4</span>

application   for   leave   to   deliver   interrogatories,   the   particular   interrogatories 
proposed to be delivered shall be submitted to the court. And that Court shall 
decide   within   seven   days   from   the   day   of   filing   of   the   said   application.   In 
deciding upon such application, the court shall take into account any offer, which 
may be made by the party sought to be interrogated to deliver particulars, or to 
make admissions, or to produce documents relating to the mattes in question, or 
any of them, and leave shall be given as to such only of the interrogatories. 
</p><p id="p_12">      Interrogatories cannot be allowed to be delivered in case they are in the 
nature of making fishing inquiries from the adversary. Interrogatories must be 
confined to facts which are relevant to the matters in question in the suit. (<a href="/doc/906929/" id="a_6">Tarun 
Kumar And Ors. v. Ajay Kumar</a> 61 (1996) DLT 174)
       Rules 12 to 14 of Order XI of the Code of Civil Procedure deal with the 
discovery  of documents.  All documents  relating to the matters in issue in the 
possession or power of any adversary can be inspected by means of discovery 
of   documents.   Rule   12   of   Order   11   deals   with   discovery   of   documents.   It 
provides that any party may, without filing any affidavit, apply to the Court for an 
order   directing   any  other  party  to  any   suit  to  make  discovery  on   oath  of   the 
documents which are or have been in his possession or power, relating to any 
matter in question therein.   On the hearing of such application the Court may 
either   refuse   or   adjourn   the   same,   if   satisfied   that   such   discovery   is   not 
necessary   at   that   stage   of   the   suit,   or   make   such   order,   either   generally   or 
limited  to certain   classes  documents,  as may,  in its  discretion  be  thought   fit. 
However discovery shall not be ordered when and court is of opinion that it is 
not necessary either for disposing fairly of the suit or for saving costs.
</p><p id="p_13">       Provisions of Rule 12 is to be read with Rule 14 which provides that it shall 
be lawful for the Court, at any time during the pendency of any suit, to order the 
production   by   any   party   thereto,   upon   oath   of   such   of   the   documents   in   his 
possession or power, relating to nay matter in question in such suit, as the court 
shall think right; and the court may deal with such documents, when produced, 
in such manner as shall appear just. So under Order 11 Rule 14 CPC it is lawful 
for the Court to order the production of such of the documents in the possession 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                             5</span>

or power of a party as relate to any matter in question in the suit.
</p><p id="p_14">        So   it   is   evident   that   under   Order   XI   Rule   12   of   the   Code,   a   Court   is 
competent to direct the parties to litigation to make discovery, on oath, of the 
documents which are or which have been in its possession or power relating to 
any matter in question therein. In order to exercise discretionary power under 
order   XI   Rule   12   of   the   Code   and   before   passing   any   order   therein,   it   is 
incumbent upon the Court to consider the relevancy of the document in the light 
of   the   dispute   or   controversy   between   the   parties.   Not   only   that,   the   Court 
should also seriously apply its mind, at that stage, and satisfy as to whether the 
documents asked for or sought for or ordered to be discovered, are required for 
the purpose of discovery for the effective disposal of the issues in the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_15">10. Being guided by the above said legal proposition if we assess the facts of 
the present  case, as noted above, matter is already pending since year 2006 
and the present suit has been already identify as old case. It is also not disputed 
that   present   case   remained   pending   for   many   dates,   for   recording   plaintiff's 
evidence.   It   was   possible   for   the   plaintiff   to   summons   officials   from   Delhi 
Pollution Control Committee for proving the report dated 03.10.2005 and letter 
dated 08.11.2005. It is even more important to note that plaintiff has stated in 
the   present   application   that   plaintiff   has   already   obtained   the   said   inspection 
report dated 03.10.2005 under <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_7">RTI Act</a> 2005. if plaintiff had already obtained the 
copy of said report then it was even more necessary for plaintiff to examine the 
witness   from   DPCC   to   prove   that   report.   At   this   belated   stage,   present 
application has been moved. Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff has heavily relied upon 
the judgment in Maria Margadia's Case. No doubt the ratio laid down in the said 
landmark judgment is that court must keep on putting serious endeavors to find 
out   the   truth   and   for   that   purpose   Section   30   CPC   can   be   of   held   for 
ascertaining   the   truth.   Therefore,   it   was   observed   in   the   said   judgment   that 
above  said provision  should  be put in service frequently  to find out  the truth. 
Without   disputing   the   ratio   and   the   guidelines   laid   down   in   said   judgment   of 
Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  I find that said  judgment  is not applicable  in peculiar 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                             6</span>

facts   and   circumstances   of   the   case   because   there   is   already   documents 
available   on   the   record   by   the   admission   of   the   plaintiff   in   the   present 
application.   In   such   situation   it   is   not   a   case   where   any   discovery   of   any 
document is required. Rather, document is very much available in judicial record 
and it was plaintiff's duty to prove it in accordance with law. 
</p>
<p id="p_16">11. In this  regard  it is important  to mention  here that  different  provisions  of 
CPC are for meant for  enabling the court and litigants to decide the suit early. 
There is no provisions in CPC which can be interpreted in such manner so that 
such   provision   delays   the   process   or   trial   of   any   matter.   Court   can   not   be 
expected to generate evidence for or against  either  party to the suit. Onus is 
always on parties to prove their respective version.   Therefore, in the present 
case when report in question is always available with plaintiff then no question 
of discovery  arises.  Similarly  when  report  has been  obtained  from  concerned 
department under <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_8">RTI Act</a> then also there is no necessity for any interrogatory 
for   confirming   that   report.   Rather,   report   on   the   record   was   required   to   be 
proved as per the provisions of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_9">Indian Evidence Act</a>. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">12. Ld.   counsel   for  the  plaintiff  has  also   relied  upon  two  other   judgment   of 
Hon'ble  High Court as mentioned above. However, those judgment are also on 
different   factual   and   legal   context.   Therefore,   for   the   reasons   stated   above 
application of the plaintiff stands dismissed. 
</p>
<p id="p_18">13. Having so held it is needless to mention that plaintiff can lead evidence in 
rebuttal  including  to prove  the report  in question,    if required  subject  to prior 
permission from this court. </p><pre id="pre_2">
