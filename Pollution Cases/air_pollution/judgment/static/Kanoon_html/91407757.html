                            The petitioner has come forward with the present Writ Petition praying for

                      issuance of a Writ of Mandamus to direct the respondents 1 and 2 to consider

                      the petitioner's representations, dated 05.03.2018 and 02.04.2018, thereby

                      Hosapuram    Village,   Denkanikottai   Taluk,   Krishnagiri   District,   with   all

                      certificate was also obtained from all the authorities. The petitioner transferred

                      the above Blue Metal Crushing Unit with entire assets, in favour of his sister,

                      namely Tmt.Kannammal, by way of Gift Deed and subsequently, she executed a

                      registered Gift Deed, dated 13.02.2013 in favour of her son, namely

                      Mr.Jayakanthan (impleaded sixth respondent herein) who is running the Unit in

                      the above said name of the Unit, i.e. M/s.Sree Hanuman Blue Metals.

</p><p id="p_3">                            3. It is the further case of the petitioner that while the sixth respondent is

                      running the said Unit, he entered into a Partnership Agreement with

                      Mr.Sathyamurthy/fourth respondent, Mr.Santhamurthy/fifth respondent and

                      N.Ramesh/the partner of M/s.J.R.S.Crusher/third respondent and started a Jelley

                      Manufacturing unit in the name and style of M/s.J.R.S.Crusher instead of

                      M/s.Sree Hanuman Blue Metals. It is further stated by the petitioner that the

                      respondents 3 to 5 forged the petitioner's signature as if the petitioner has given

                      "No Objection" to    the District Environmental Engineer/second respondent in

                      favour of the respondents 3 to 5 to enable them to apply and process for further

                      statutory requirements.

<p id="p_4">                            4. It is also stated by the petitioner that the second respondent issued a

                      letter to the petitioner on 18.11.2015, vide proceedings in Lr.No.F HSR

                      0574/DEE/TNPCB/HSR 2015, which was received by the petitioner on 30.11.2015

                      and immediately, the petitioner gave objection to the second respondent on

                      respondent, as the said No Objection, which is dated 02.11.2015 said to have

                      been given by the petitioner, to the second respondent, was a forged one, as the

                      petitioner did not sign any papers. Further, based on the forgery of the

                      petitioner's signature for giving consent letter, the respondents 3 to 5 gave an

                      application in File No.CTE 3234752 on 07.12.2015 requesting consent order from

                      the second respondent for running M/s.J.R.S.Crusher. In this regard, the

                      petitioner made a complaint to the respondents 1 and 2 requesting not to close

                      the petitioner's file in respect of M/s.Sree Hanuman Blue Metals, so as to resume

                      the operations early.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                            5. It is the grievance of the petitioner that the respondents 3 to 5 colluded

                      each other and forged the petitioner's signature and thereby, created No

                      Objection Certificate from the second respondent/DEE of the TNPCB. Moreover,

                      the petitioner personally approached the first respondent/TNPCB and informed

                      about the alleged forged "No Objection Certificate" stated to have been given by

                      the petitioner in respect of the consent being given for running the Unit. It is the

                      further stand of the petitioner that he had not signed any letter to

                      M/s.J.R.S.Crusher,      Partners,   who are   respondents   3   to 5,   who have

                      impersonated and forged the petitioner's signature. In this backdrop, the

                      petitioner lodged a complaint to the Superintendent of Police, Krishnagiri, on

                      19.03.2018 in File No.659 of 2018, and this complaint was forwarded to the

</p>
<p id="p_6">                              6. Since the respondents 3 to 5 impersonated and forged the petitioner's

                      signature and obtained an illegal consent order from the second respondent, the

                      petitioner gave representations to the first respondent on 05.03.2018 and

                      02.04.2018, followed by reminder dated 02.06.2018, for cancellation of the

                      alleged consent order, dated 15.11.2017 issued by the second respondent in

                      favour of the third respondent. Since no action is taken on the said

                      representations, the petitioner has come before this Court by filing this Writ

                      Petition for the relief stated supra.

                      affidavit, inter-alia stated that as against the order passed by the first and second

                      respondents, the petitioner has to only prefer appeal under the provisions of the

                      Air and Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>. Learned counsel

                      appearing for the respondents 3 to 5 further submitted that absolutely, there is

                      no forgery or collusion as alleged by the petitioner. Hence, he prayed for

                      dismissal of the present Writ Petition.

                      matter, and also considering the limited scope of the prayer made in this Writ

                      Petition, this Court directs the respondents 1 and 2 to consider the said

                      representations, dated 05.03.2018 and 02.04.2018, conduct enquiry, afford an

                      opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and necessary parties including the
