                    WP(C).NO. 7457 of 2012
                   ---------------------------------
            Dated this the 26th day of March, 2012

                             JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">       In this writ petition the petitioner is challenging Exts.P1 to

P4.    Ext.P1 is a building permit granted by the 2nd respondent

Panchayat in favour of the 6th respondent for construction of an

industrial shed. Ext.P2 is the approval of layout issued by the

Senior Town Planner, Ernakulam with respect to grant of building

permit.     Ext.P3 is the consent to establish issued by the 3rd

respondent to the 6th respondent for establishing an industry

engaged     in manufacture of 'Cement Bricks'.        Ext.P4 is the

installation permission granted by the 4th respondent for

establishment of the said industry at the building, construction of

which was permitted.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.   Contention of the petitioner is that all the above

consents, permissions, and licences were obtained either through

misrepresentation or non representation of the real facts. The

proposed unit is situated at a distance of 15 meters from the

residence of the petitioner, is the allegation.        If the unit is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WP(C).7457 /2012                2</span>


permitted to be established that will cause severe problems of

nuisance, sound pollution, and health hazards, is the submission.

</p><p id="p_3">       3. I take note of the fact that the provisions contained

under the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act and the Kerala Panchayat

Building Rules 2011 as well as the Kerala Panchayat Raj (Issue

of Licence to Dangerous and Offensive Trades and Factories)

Rules 1996, enables any person aggrieved by the grant of any

building permit or installation permit to challenge such

proceedings before the appropriate statutory authority. As per

section 276 of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act the petitioner has

got an effective and alternative remedy to approach the Tribunal

for Local Self Government Institutions, in an appeal. Ext.P3 is

the consent to establish granted under the provisions of the

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974 and the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981.     Both statutes

provide appellate remedy and the appellate forums have already

been constituted under the provisions of the respective statutes.

</p><p id="p_4">       4. Under the above circumstances this writ petition filed

challenging Exts.P1 to P4 in a proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WP(C).7457 /2012                 3</span>


cannot be entertained, which in effect will permit bypassing of all

the statutory remedies.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that if the

petitioner has to approach different statutory authorities the

same will result in multiple      proceedings and there will be

chances of conflicting decisions.    When the statute prescribes

specific remedies,     this court cannot ignore such remedies

provided and may not be justified in exercising the discretionary

original jurisdiction to consolidate all such challenges. I do not

find any special circumstances prevailing to entertain this writ

petition,   which is one filed by-passing       the   effective and

alternative statutory remedies. Hence the writ petition fails and

the same is accordingly dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      However, statutory remedies if any available under law to

the petitioner to challenge Exts.P1 to P4 will stand reserved.</p><pre id="pre_2">
