                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                          W.P (C) No. 2454 OF 2011
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     Dated, this the 3rd day of March, 2011

                                      JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The prayers in the Writ Petition are as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_2">
         i. to call for the records leading to Exts. P1, P3, P5, P6, P7 and P9 and to

         quash the same by issuance of a writ of certiorari or any other similar writ,

         or order.
</p>
<p id="p_3">         ii. to issue a writ of mandamus or any such direction, writ or order, directing

         the respondents to consider the detailed submissions of the petitioner and

         the various options put forth through Exhibits P2, P4, P8 and P10 and to

         grant the petitioner a reasonable opportunity of personal hearing before

         proceeding further with the same.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         iii. to issue an interim directions staying all proceedings pursuant to Exts.

         P1, P3, P5, P6, P7 and P9

         iv. to grant to the petitioner such other incidental reliefs including the costs

         of these proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      2. The respondent has filed a statement pointing out that the idea

and understanding of the petitioner is quite wrong and misconceived and

that the respondent is having every right to proceed against the petitioner

and the concerned vessel by name ' M.V. Nand Aparajitha', which ran

aground at the shores of the island and caused much damage to the

peaceful living of the inhabitants of the island. It is stated that the demand

made to salvage the vesseI did not result any fruitful event and that there is

every chance to have the sea polluted, which in turn is much adversely to

W.P. (C) No. 2454 of 2011

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      2</span>

affect the inhabitants of the islands who depend upon the sea water to

have their drinking purpose and other daily needs, after desalination in the

desalination plants set up in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       3. It is brought to light from the pleadings and proceedings that

because of the apprehended threat to the 'flora and fauna' including the

coral reaves, the fuel from the vessel was sought to be taken out to such

other places to avoid oil spillage and so also, part of the cargo has been

removed as well. It is stated that, the petitioner has not acceded to the

demand made by the respondent with regard to the salvage operation and

is seeking to evade the responsibility, stating that, the vessel could be

treated as an 'abandoned' one and that there is no threat of any pollution.

</p><p id="p_7">       4.   The learned standing counsel appearing for the respondent

submits that, since nothing was turned out in positive from the part of the

petitioner in spite of various notices and reminders including Ext. P9, a

complaint was preferred under the relevant provisions of the Water

(Prevention furtherance to issuance of Ext. P9, a complaint was preferred

under the relevant provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of

Pollution) Act</a> 1974 before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Amini and

cognizance was also taken on 24.01.2011. It was after knowing the above

fact, that the petitioner has preferred this Writ Petition, submits the learned

standing counsel for the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_8">W.P. (C) No. 2454 of 2011

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>

</p><p id="p_9">      5. In the course of the proceedings, the petitioner filed I.A. No. 3214

of 2011, to implead      the Administrator as well, pointing out that, the

aground vessel in fact is liable to be treated as a "wreck" as defined under

<a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_2">Section 3</a> (58) of the <a href="/doc/681709/" id="a_3">Merchant Shipping Act</a>, 1958. It is also stated that the

action to be taken for salvage of the 'wreck' is as provided under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Section

391</a> (1) of the said Act and the that the Central Government has already

appointed the Administrator as the competent authority in this regard. The

contentions of the petitioner in this regard are sought to be opposed on

behalf of the respondent, by the learned standing counsel.

</p><p id="p_10">      6. Considering the turn of events, this Court does not propose to go

into the disputed questions of facts; more so, in view of the fact that the

matter is pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Amini. In the

said circumstances, the petitioner is free to approach the concerned

Magistrate's Court or to challenge the said proceedings in accordance with

law, by way of appropriate proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      Reserving the rights and liberties as above, interference is declined

and the Writ Petition is dismissed.
</p>
