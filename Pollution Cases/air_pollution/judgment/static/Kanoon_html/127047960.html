Sri.B.V.Shankara      Narayana         Rao,    learned   counsel

appearing for respondent Nos.2 and 3, Sri.Gowthamdev.

C.Ullal, learned counsel for respondent Nos.4 and

Sri.H.S.Prashanth, learned counsel for respondent No.5.


</p><p id="p_24">      15.    Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

petitioner submits that the issue which has been raised

by the petitioner in the complaint at Annexure-Q dated

17.8.2010 has already been adjudicated by the Division

Bench of this Court in Writ Petition No.936/2006 and

other connected matters, disposed              of on 27.11.2009.

He has drawn our attention to issue No.5 framed by the

Division Bench in W.P.No.936/2006. This Court has

considered in detail as to whether there is violation of

zonal regulations and building Bye-laws while putting

up the construction in question in the aforesaid land.

The   Division    Bench    has        categorically    held    that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                            14</span>


construction of the building by the petitioner is neither

in violation of zonal regulations nor building bye-laws.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court has confirmed the order of

the Division Bench and     has dismissed the SLP. The

review petitions as also the curative petition have also

been dismissed. On the basis of the liberty reserved by

the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SLP (C) No.6833/2010

dated 29.03.2010 once again he has filed complaint at

Annexure-Q before the Joint Commissioner, BBMP. The

Joint Commissioner after hearing the parties has

rejected the complaint by order at Annexure-R dated

3/4.12.2010.    This   order    has   attained   finality.

Thereafter, the petitioner has filed complaint before the

Hon'ble Lokayukta and the Lokayukta has issued

directions in its order dated 07.07.2011. The directions

are contrary to the order of the Division Bench which

has been affirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It is

submitted that the Lokayukta is not justified in

directing the Government to take action against the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                   15</span>


petitioner having regard to the order of the Division

Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">        16.    On      the    other    hand,     learned       counsel

appearing for the 5th respondents has sought to justify

the impugned order. It is argued that the petitioner has

filed     writ      petition      before       this      Court        in

W.P.No.37407/2011             challenging      the      endorsement

issued    by     the    Corporation     at     annexure-W          dated

16.09.2011       without      challenging      the     order   of    the

Lokayukta at Annexure- T. Thus, the writ petition is

barred under Order 2 Rule 2 of the Code of Civil

Procedure.       It is further submitted that the Hon'ble

Supreme        Court    has    reserved      liberty    to   the    fifth

respondent to pursue the matter with the appropriate

authorities if there are any other statutory violations.

That's how the petitioner has made the complaint before

the Lokayukta.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                               16</span><p id="p_27">


</p><p id="p_28">      17.   We have carefully considered the arguments

of the learned counsel made at the bar and perused the

materials placed on record.
</p>
<p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">      18.   The fifth respondent had filed a Writ Petition

No.936/2006       against   the    petitioner,    the   State

Government and its instrumentalities for various reliefs.

The contentions urged against the petitioner was that

the plan for construction of the building was issued in

violation of zonal regulations and bye-laws applicable to

the plot in question. This Court while framing the points

for consideration has framed the following point on the

basis of the rival contentions of the parties:-



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      "5.Whether the construction of the building is
      in violation of the Zonal Regularizations and
      Building Bye laws applicable to the plot in
      question.</blockquote><p id="p_31">



</p><p id="p_32">      19.   The above point has been answered by at

paragraph 52 as under:-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                           17</span><p id="p_33">


</p><p id="p_34">       "Further, construction of the building
upon the plot in question by the Construction
Co., is not in violation of Zonal Regulation and
Building Bye laws applicable to the property
in question, for the reason that under the
Zoning Regulation the land used is for
residential purpose and comes within the
residential zone, is not a contested fact,
which is evidenced from the conversion order,
passed by the Special Deputy Commissioner
under Section 95(3) of the KLR Act and the
said order is not challenged either by the
petitioner or any other person and further
construction of the building in the plot to
provide apartments to the senior citizens as
per the sanctioned plan by the Commissioner
of    city   Municipality,     Mahadevapura           and
further floor area, covered area, height, etc.,
as provided in item II (3) to the zoning of land
use     and    Regulations       of    B.D.A.    is    in
accordance with Regulations and further
sanction      of    the   plan        by   the    CMC
Mahadevapura as it is the local self Authority
as     per    the    Government         order    dated
07.03.1996. Hence the construction of the
building by the Construction Co., is neither in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                              18</span>


     violation of zonal Regulations or Building Bye
     Laws applicable to the property in question".



</p><p id="p_35">     20.     It is clear that this Court has adverted to the

rival contentions of the parties and has categorically

held that the construction by the petitioner is neither in

violation of the zonal regulations nor building bye-laws

applicable to the property in question. As stated above,

the SLP filed by the fifth respondent challenging the

said order has been dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court on 29.3.2010, subject to the observations as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">             "We are not inclined to interfere with the
     impugned order(s). Accordingly, the Special
     Leave Petitions are dismissed. However, if
     there    are   any   statutory   violations,   the
     petitioner would be at liberty to pursue the
     matter with the appropriate authorities".</blockquote><p id="p_36">

</p><p id="p_37">     21.     It is admitted position that the review

petitions filed by the fifth respondent were dismissed by

the Apex Court, so also the curative petition. Thus, the

order of the Division Bench in W.P.No.936/2006 has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                               19</span>


attained finality. On the basis of the liberty reserved to

the fifth respondent to pursue the matter if there are

any statutory provisions, the fifth respondent filed the

complaint   before     the   Joint   Commissioner    as   per

Annexure-Q     dated    17.8.2010.     A   reading   of   this

complaint would clearly disclose that he has sought for

adjudication of the matter again which has been

concluded by the Division Bench and upheld by the

Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">      22.   It is no doubt true that he has raised certain

other issues in the complaint dated 17.8.2010.            The

Joint Commissioner Town Planning, Mahadevapura,

who is the competent authority to decide the issue has

issued show cause notice as per Annexure-Q1 dated

23.8.2010 to the petitioner and has passed the order as

per   Annexure-R     dated     3/4.12.2010    rejecting   the

complaint and extending one year time to the petitioner

to complete the construction. This order passed by the

Assistant Director Town Planning BBMP, Mahadevapura

Bangalore, has not been challenged by the fifth
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                 20</span>


respondent. Thus, this order has also become final and

binding between the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">     23.    Thereafter, the petitioner filed a complaint

before the Hon'ble Lokayukta as per Annexure-S dated

2.01.2011 and on the basis of this complaint, the

impugned order at Annexure-T dated 07.07.2011 has

been passed.
</p>
<p id="p_42">
</p><p id="p_43">     24.    Having perused the entire materials on

record, we are of the view that insofar as the violation of

zonal regulations are concerned, the matter has been

concluded by the Division Bench and upheld by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court.           Even in respect of certain

other allegations relating to the statutory violations said

to have been committed by the petitioner, the Joint

Commissioner has held an enquiry and passed an order

at Annexure-R which has also not been challenged.

Therefore, the question of once again directing the

Competent      Authority   to    withdraw   the   permission

extended to the petitioner for construction of building
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                              21</span>


blocks does not arise. We are of the view that the order

at Annexure-T dated 07.07.2011 cannot be sustained.


</p><p id="p_44">        25.   That brings us to the second question as to

the maintainability of the writ petition under Order 2

Rule 2 of CPC. It is no doubt true that the petitioner has

filed   W.P.No37407/2011      challenging   the   order   at

Annexure - W. Annexure-W was passed by the Joint

Commissioner BBMP, Mahadevapura, whereby earlier

extension of time granted to the petitioner at Annexure-

R was withdrawn. Therefore, the cause of action for the

said writ petition was issuance of Annexure-W. In the

present petition the petitioner has questioned the

validity of the direction of the Hon'ble Lokayukta at

Annexure-T. The cause of action for this writ petition is

different from the one pleaded in the other writ

petitions.    It is necessary to state here that when the

High Court exercises extraordinary jurisdiction under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, it aims at securing a

very speedy and efficacious remedy to a person, whose

legal or constitutional right has been infringed. If all the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                             22</span>


elaborate and technical rules laid down in Civil P.C. are

to be applied to writ proceedings the very object and

purpose is likely to be defeated.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">     26.   Taking into consideration, the explanation

added to Section 141 of the CPC, the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in Puran Singh and Others Vs.              State of

Punjab and others' - (AIR 1996 Sc 1092) has held as

under:-
</p>
<p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">     "When      the     High        Court   exercises
     extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a>
     of the Constitution, it aims at securing a
     very speedy and efficacious remedy to a
     person, whose legal or Constitutional right
     has been infringed. If all the elaborate and
     technical ruled laid down in Civil P.C. are to
     be applied to writ proceedings the very object
     and purpose is likely to be defeated. In view
     of the conflicting opinions expressed by the
     different Courts, the Parliament by the
     aforesaid amending Act (1976) introduced
     the explanation saying that in Section 141 of
     the Code the expression "proceedings" does
     not include "any proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                               23</span>


      226</a> of the Constitution" and statutorily
      recognized the views expressed by some of
      the Courts that writ proceedings under
      <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of the Constitution shall not be
      deemed     to   be    proceedings       within   the
      meaning of Section 141 of the Code. After
      the    introduction    of    the   explanation    to
      Section 141 of the Code, it can be said that
      when     <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Section      141</a>    provides    that    the
      procedure prescribed in the Code in regard
      to suits shall be followed, as far as it can be
      made applicable "in all proceedings in any
      Court of Civil Jurisdiction" it shall not
      include a proceeding under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article 226</a> of the
      Constitution. In this background, it cannot
      be held that the provisions contained in
      Order 22 of the Code are applicable per se to
      writ proceedings."
</p>
<p id="p_49">

</p><p id="p_50">      27.    Therefore, the contention of the learned

counsel appearing for respondent No.5 that the writ

petition is barred under Order 2 Rule 2 of CPC is

rejected.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                              24</span><p id="p_51">


</p><p id="p_52">      28.    In the light of the aforesaid discussion, we

pass the following
