<p id="p_4">         3.      The complaint refers to inspection of the premises of the
         petitioner      company       carried      out    on      14.6.1988           and       the
         inspection report was also prepared on the same date. The
         complaint is filed on 03.11.1988, which refers to non-
         compliance        of substituted <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> (1). It is further
         submitted that Rules framed in exercise of powers conferred
         by Sub-sections (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/31000761/" id="a_4">Section 54</a> of the Air (Prevention
         and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, in Chapter IV under the
         heading of 'Prevention and Control of Air Pollution' prescribed
         under Rule 9 for preferring an application for consent under
         Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_6">Section 21</a>. Proviso to above Rule provided
         that where any person, immediately before the declaration of
         any area as air pollution control area, operates in such area
         any industrial plant for the purpose of any industry specified in
         the Schedule I shall make the application for consent within a
         period of four months from the date of such declaration of the
         area.

<p id="p_5">         4.      Form-I is prescribed under Rule 9 (1) for preferring

         therefore, it is submitted that the complaint lacks statutory
         force and powers invoked by the complainant is contrary to
         law inasmuch Rule 9 ought to have been amended for bringing
         period for preferring an application within a period of three
         months on par with proviso to Sub-section (1) and (2) of

</pre><p id="p_6">         5.       As against above, Shri Vaibhav Vyas, learned advocate
         for respondent no.2 would contend that Act 1981 is in force in
         the State of Gujarat with effect from 30.3.1981 and Gujarat
         Pollution Control Board came into existence on 15.10.1974.
         Rules of 1983 were published vide Notification dated 6.8.1984
         and all the Districts of the State of Gujarat have been brought
         within the purview of Air Pollution Control of the Department.
         According to Shri Vyas, the petitioners have not preferred any
         application seeking consent either prior to or after 1.4.1988
         and further date of complaint is 3.11.1988, admittedly after
         completion of three months under Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_9">Section
         21</a> of the Act. Shri Vyas, however, contends that time limit of
         four months prescribed under Rule on the contrary will benefit
         the petitioner, giving one month more than what is prescribed
         under the Act.
