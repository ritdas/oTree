       HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJAY RASTOGI
           HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ARINDAM LODH

                               Judgment
12/6/2018

        Instant writ appeal is directed against judgment &amp; order

dt.30th March, 2012 passed by the learned Single Judge in WP(C)

No.140/2012.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">2.       The appellant at the relevant point of time was serving

as Executive Engineer in the Tripura State Pollution Control Board

who at present is working as Member-Secretary of the Board. For

some alleged delinquency being committed by him, in discharge

of his official duties, departmental proceedings were initiated

against him and at one point of time, he was placed under

suspension in exercise of R.10(2) of the CCS(CCA) Rules, 1965.


</p><p id="p_6">3.      The appellant-petitioner earlier challenged the order of

suspension in WP(C) No.161/2011 before the ld. Single Judge of

this Court and his contention was that the delinquent placed

under suspension, beyond the period of 90 days has to be

reviewed by a review committee to be constituted by the

Authority but as there was no review of the order of suspension

as envisaged under Rule 10(6) &amp; (7) of the CCS(CCA) Rules,

1965   the   suspension   in    consequence    stands   automatically

revoked and taking note of sub-rule (6) &amp; (7) of Rule 10,

CCS(CCA) Rules, 1965 the order of suspension came to be

revoked vide judgment dt.22.12.2011.
</p><p id="p_7">                             Page - 3 of 5


</p><p id="p_8">4.     Thereafter the appellant again approach this Court by

filing WP(C) No.140/2012 assailing the disciplinary proceedings

initiated under the CCS(CCA) Rules, 1965, as adopted by the

Board and that was summarily rejected vide judgment impugned

dt.30th March, 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">5.      What reveals to this Court is that after taking note of the

disciplinary Rules 1965 order of his suspension was revoked and

he has now raised objection as a defence that the Rules, 1965

are not applicable for the reason that it has not so far been

approved by the Government, which is mandatory as per

Sec.12(3A) of the Water(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974, in absence thereof any further order being passed for the

alleged delinquency by the disciplinary authority, on conclusion of

the disciplinary proceedings, is wholly without any authority and

competence needs to be interfered by this Court.


</p><p id="p_11">6.      The learned Single Judge after taking note of the

submissions made observed that at one stage the petitioner

indeed invoked the provisions of the CCS(CCA) Rules, 1965 for

revocation of the order of suspension and since the disciplinary

enquiry initiated against him under the same set of Rules 1965 is

not to his convenience has taken a summersault to question the

procedure which has been adopted by the respondent in

conducting a disciplinary enquiry for the misconduct which he had

committed in discharge of his official duties under the Rules 1965

which may not come to his rescue at this belated stage.
</p><p id="p_12">                                 Page - 4 of 5


</p><p id="p_13">7.         We also find no substance to take a contrary view than

the view taken by the ld. Single Judge and further observe that

Rules of 1965 lays down a procedure for holding disciplinary

action against an employee who commits misconduct in discharge

of   his   official   duties   and   for   fairness   in   action,   private

management can also adopt the CCS(CCA) Rules, 1965 for the

purpose of conducting disciplinary action against their employees

for which no separate approval from the government or any other

agency is required.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">8.         In the instant case, the disciplinary action was initiated

against the appellant-petitioner under the CCS(CCA) Rules, 1965,

which were adopted only for the purpose of affording reasonable

opportunity of hearing to the delinquent at all the stages while

conducting disciplinary enquiry against him and even if we find

any substance in the submission made by the petitioner's

counsel, at least, it can be an administrative instructions which

can always be adopted by the authority in conducting disciplinary

action against the employee who commits any misconduct in

discharge of official duties and as long as the action initiated and

conducted by the authority is in compliance with the principles of

natural justice and in terms of the procedure prescribed under

the Rules of 1965, we find no error in the decision making

process adopted by the respondents may call for interference.


</p><p id="p_16">9.         After having heard counsel for the appellant, we find no

error in the order passed by the ld. Single Judge which may call
                                               Page - 5 of 5


for our interference. Consequently, the appeal being devoid of

merit stands dismissed. No costs.
