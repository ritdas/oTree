            for the respondent.

                               *****
</pre>
<p id="p_1">T.S.Thakur, C.J. (Oral)

             This petition for a writ of certiorari calls in question the

correctness of an order dated 3.7.2008 passed by the Punjab Pollution

Control Board whereby the petitioner company was directed to submit a

bank guarantee for a sum of Rs. 10 lacs valid for a period of one year

to ensure regular operation and maintenance of its Effluent Treatment
 CWP No. 12519 of 2008                              [2]

Plant for compliance with       effluents standards prescribed for the

industry in question. The controversy arises in the following backdrop.

</p><p id="p_2">            The petitioner company has set up a medium scale

industrial unit at village Rajgarh, Tehsil Rajpura, District Patiala which

is   engaged   primarily   in     manufacturing     and   marketing    of

processed/frozen foods. The petitioner's case is that the industry set up

by it is seasonal in nature and operates only for a period of two or three

months in a calendar year. Its further case is that the sister concern of

the petitioner company by the name M/s Green Bagh Foods Limited is

also engaged in     manufacture of Jams and Tomato Ketchup and is

located in the same premises but remains operational almost throughout

the year. Since both the companies referred to above are required to

have an Effluent Treatment Plant in terms of the statutes in force, the

petitioner company appears to have set up a Common Effluent

Treatment Plant for treating the effluents discharged from their

respective units. While the petitioner's case is that Effluent Treatment

Plant so installed is functional and maintains standards stipulated for

that purpose, the respondent Board disputes that assertion.

</p><p id="p_3">            According to the respondent Board, the industry set up by

the petitioner company was visited by its officers on 01.02.2008 when

it was observed that the Effluent Treatment Plant installed by the

industry was not in operation and that untreated effluent was being

discharged onto the adjacent land for stagnation. The inspection also

revealed the presence of untreated effluents in the adjacent land, a

sample whereof was also collected by the officer conducting the

inspection for analysis. The test reports revealed that the effluents
 CWP No. 12519 of 2008                               [3]

discharged by the unit were beyond permissible limit prescribed by the

Board. Acting on that basis, the Board appears to have taken the view

that the petitioner company was in default of the requirements of the

Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, resulting in the

issue of the order impugned in this petition whereby the industry has

been directed to submit a bank guarantee for a sum of Rs. 10 lacs valid

for a period of one year and to maintain and operate the Effluent

Treatment Plant and ensure that effluent standards prescribed are not

violated. Aggrieved, the petitioner-company has assailed               the

correctness of the said directions in the present petition.

</p><p id="p_4">             We have heard learned counsel for the parties at a

considerable length and perused the record.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             Mr. Patwalia, learned counsel appearing for the Board

submitted, and in our opinion rightly so, that this petition has with the

passage of time     become infructuous and the issues raised therein

rendered academic. He further submits that the order in question

requiring the petitioner's unit to furnish a bank guarantee for a sum of

Rs. 10 lacs for a period of one year, necessarily means that the bank

guarantee, if furnished in terms of the said order, would be valid only

till 31.07.2009. He further argued that since consent to operate has to be

obtained by every industrial unit on an annual basis and an application

for such consent has to be filed two months before the expiry of the

consent earlier granted, the petitioner company will have to file an

application for grant of consent for the year 2010, in which event, the

Board would examine the issue and pass a fresh order on the subject in

accordance with law. He urged that the petitioner could be directed to
 CWP No. 12519 of 2008                                [4]

make such an application within two weeks from today, in which event

the competent authority in the Board would pass an appropriate order

on the subject within two weeks thereafter. All other issues raised by

the petitioner's unit could in that view be left open to be agitated at an

appropriate stage, if the occasion to do so arise.

</p><p id="p_6">             Ms. Gandhi, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner

unit had no serious objection to that procedure being followed. She

submitted that while the petitioner company is ready and willing to

make an application for the grant of consent to operate for the year

2010, the Board ought to dispose of the said request quickly so that the

petitioner's working for the remainder of the current year is not

affected. She further submitted that the petitioner's unit has installed an

Effluent Treatment Plant although the same is common to its sister

concern M/s Green Bagh Foods Ltd. and that it would ensure that the

said plant is not only functional but also serves the purpose for which it

has been installed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             In the circumstances, therefore, it is unnecessary for us to

go into the question whether the order passed by           Environmental

Engineer of the Punjab Pollution Control Board demanding a bank

guarantee of Rs. 10 lacs suffered from any error of law or procedure.

Since the period for which the said guarantee was to be furnished has

already expired, the entire issue regarding the validity of that order

appears to have become academic. It is also obvious that the unit cannot

operate without proper consent from the Board. The request of the

petitioner for grant of consent for the year 2009 appears to have been

filed after the passing of impugned order and has remained pending
 CWP No. 12519 of 2008                                  [5]

before the Board ostensibly because of the pendency of the present writ

petition. In that view, therefore, any order which the competent

authority in         the Board may pass on the application filed by the

petitioner for the grant of consent to operate should work to the benefit

of the unit from the date the order is made not necessarily w.e.f.

01.01.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_8">               In fairness to Mr. Patwalia, we must mention that he had no

quarrel with that proposition and submitted that if an order granting

consent is made the same can be effective for a period of one year from

the date it is issued.
</p>
<p id="p_9">               In the result, we dispose of this writ petition with the

following directions:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">               i)            Upon receipt of an application, the competent
                             authority in the Pollution Control Board shall
                             afford to the petitioner an opportunity of being
                             heard in the matter and pass an appropriate
                             order in accordance with law within two weeks
                             thereafter.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">               ii)           In case the competent authority decides to
                             grant consent to operate conditionally or
                             otherwise, the same shall became operative
                             from the date the order is made and shall
                             continue to remain operative for the period
                             mentioned in the order.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">               iii)          In case the consent is refused, the petitioner's
                             unit shall have the liberty to seek appropriate
                             redress against the refusal in appropriate
                             proceedings before the appropriate Forum.

proceedings are left open to be determined in appropriate proceedings,

if an occasion to do so arises. No costs.</blockquote><p id="p_10">
