:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                These writ petitions have been  filed  by  the  different
Trade Unions registered under the <a href="/doc/1980557/" id="a_1">Trade Unions Act</a>,1926, representing the
Plantation Workmen employed in the various Estates in Valparai, Anaimalai
areas in  Coimbatore  District.  According to them there are about 24,000
permanent workmen and about 26,000  temporary  workmen  and  daily  rated       
workmen employed  in  the  Estate/respondents  2 to 28.  Considering that
identical issues are raised in  all  the  above  writ  petitions,  it  is
convenient to refer to the facts stated in W.P.No.4884 of 2002.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                2.According   to  the  petitioner,  the  Union  has  been 
entering into various settlements from  time  to  time  right  from  1962
separately  for  each category of workmen regarding the wages and working 
conditions.  The last of such settlement was entered into between  Unions
and  the  first respondent under <a href="/doc/664381/" id="a_2">Section 18(1)</a> of the Industrial Disputes
Act ( hereinafter called "the Act") on 10.7.1996`.  Though the period  of
settlement  was  for  three years, ending on 31.12.1998, the terms of the     
settlements stand automatically extended even after the  said  period  in
terms of  <a href="/doc/1545865/" id="a_3">Section 19(2)</a> of the Act.  Regarding wages of Supervisory staff
and the skilled workers  also,  similar  settlement  was  arrived  at  on
2.5.2000  for  the  period  commencing  from 1.9.1999 and for the general
category on 12/13.1.2000 for  the  period  commencing  from  1.1.1999  to
31.12.2001.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                3.In  terms  of  such  settlement the employees have also
been receiving apart from wages, Dearness Allowance, incentive etc.    On
completion of the period of settlement, they had demanded revision of the
wages considering  the  price  of  essential  commodities.   But to their
surprise and shock the Planters Association  of  Tamil  Nadu,  the  first
respondent   herein   (P.A.T.)  issued  three  individual  notices  dated
24.10.2001 informing their intention to terminate  the  settlement  dated
10.7.199 6, 2.5.2000 and 12/13.1.2000 with effect from 31.12.2001.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                4.On  receipt of such notices almost all the Unions wrote
letters objecting to  the  proposals  and  requested  withdrawal  of  the
proposals.  Instead of holding talks and arriving at a mutual settlement,
respondents  2 to 28 sent individuals notices on 30.11.2001 and 8.12.2001
to all Unions under <a href="/doc/50580743/" id="a_4">Section 9-A</a> of the Act seeking  to  withdraw,  alter,
modify the  existing  benefits  flowing  from  the  said settlement.  The
changes thus contemplated not only  result  in  reduction  of  wages  and
incentives,  but  also changes in the work pattern resulting in increased
work load.  A conciliation notice dated 7.12.2001 was received  from  the
Commissioner of  Labour,  29th  respondent.    The  Union  and  the first      
respondent Association took part in the Conciliation proceedings and  the
29th respondent advised respondents 2 to 28 not to give the effect to the
proposed  changes and also both parties to have bilateral negotiations to
resolve issues amicably.  As on the  date  of  the  writ  petition,  nine
rounds  of  talks  were  held,  but  the  first respondent was adamant in
implementing the proposed change in working conditions.  Respondents 2 to         
28 have also notified that the wages and other benefits for the month  of
January,  2002 would be paid only in accordance with the changes proposed
in the notice issued under <a href="/doc/50580743/" id="a_5">Section 9-A</a> of the Act.  The  disbursement  of
wages  will be made with effect from 7th or 10th of every month depending
on the strength of the workers in each of the estate.  According  to  the
petitioner Union, as per the proposed change each workmen will lose about
30 to  40  per  cent.  Consequently, the workers refused to receive wages
for the month of January, 2002.  It is further stated that the settlement
cannot come to an end without following the procedure under <a href="/doc/1545865/" id="a_6">Section 19(2)</a>
of the Act.  It was also not open to the management to change  the  terms
and conditions of service during the pendency of the dispute.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                5.In their counter, the  Planters  Association  have  not
disputed  the  details  relating  to  the  execution of the settlement as
arrived at between the parties as pleaded by the petitioners;  but  would
state that the agreements were terminated by issuing notice under <a href="/doc/1545865/" id="a_7">Section
19(2)</a> of  the  Act  with  effect from 31.12.2001.  Thereafter, individual
notices have been issued by each of the Estate separately  under  <a href="/doc/50580743/" id="a_8">Section
9-A</a> of  the  Act and not by the Association.  It is also pleaded that the
writ petition is not maintainable since  the  individual  Estate  or  the
Planters  Association  is  not a State or Instrumentality of the State in
terms of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_9">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India and  hence  no  mandamus  
can be  issued against respondents 1 to 28.  As a result of the financial
crisis faced by  the  Tea  industry  and  the  Plantation,  the  proposed 
revision  of  wages  was  imminent and necessary and in fact a High Level
Meeting of the  representatives  of  the  employers  and  the  Union  was
convened  and  also  a  meeting  took place with the Hon'ble Minister for     
Labour and pursuant to the said meeting  they  had  requested  the  Joint
Commissioner of Labour by their letter dated 29.11.2001 to convene a High
Level meeting.    Notice  under  <a href="/doc/50580743/" id="a_10">Section 9-A</a> of the Act was given between
30.11.2001 and 8.12.2001.  Notice of Conciliation was given by the  Joint
Commissioner on  7.12.200 1.  Even prior to 1.1.2002 (when the changes in      
the condition of service were to take effect) on  18.12.2001  itself  the
Commissioner   directed   both  parties  to  hold  direct  talks  between     
themselves.  Such talks did commence on 1.1.2002 and continued on several  
dates.  Therefore,  there  was  no  Conciliation  proceeding  pending  on
1.2.2002 or  subsequently.  It is further stated that the Association has
only a representative status and hence the intimation given by the Labour
Commissioner to the Association cannot be treated as notice to individual
employers.  The parties are still carrying on by-partite negotiations  in
which the  petitioner's  Union  are  also  taking  part.    There  is  no
contravention of <a href="/doc/1564754/" id="a_11">Section 33</a> of the Act in any manner.  Even assuming that
a Conciliation proceeding was pending as alleged by the  petitioners  and
that  there  was  any violation of <a href="/doc/1564754/" id="a_12">Section 33</a> of the Act, the petitioners
should have filed a complaint under <a href="/doc/1980557/" id="a_13">Section  33-A</a>  of  the  Act  and  the
Conciliation Officer should have held discussions in an attempt to arrive
at an  interim  arrangement.   <a href="/doc/1980557/" id="a_14">Section 33-A</a> of the Act itself provides an
alternative and efficacious remedy and hence, there was no  justification
to  invoke  the  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India.
</p>


<p id="p_6">                6.It  is  further  stated that earlier there was a direct
industrywise negotiation covering all the areas and because of the delay,
the Unions operating in Nilgiris District, has expressed desire to arrive
at a settlement in respect of their areas, covering  plantations  in  the
Taluks of Udhagamandalam, Kotagiri, Coonoor.  A settlement was arrived at
agreeing  on  fixing  wages  at  Rs.70/- per day plus Attendance bonus of
Rs.2/- per day and thus in respect of a major Plantation area, settlement
had been arrived at.  The settlement was to remain  in  operation  for  a
period of  three  years.  It is further stated that the settlement covers
more than 12,000 workmen.  In fact, the Unions affiliated to the  Central
Federations   to  which  some  of  the  present  petitioner's  Union  are     
affiliated, are also signatories to the said settlement.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                7.In the counter, further details have  also  been  given
which according to the first respondent, would provide more than adequate
reasons to  justify  the downward revision of wages as contemplated.  The
circumstances  thus   expressed   include   various   factors   such   as        
Liberalisation  policy  of  Government  of  India, Trade policy allegedly
dictated by the World Trade Organisation (W.T.O.), general  recession  in
the industries  etc.    Considering the issues which are relevant for the
disposal of these writ petitions, there is  no  need  to  go  into  those
details.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                8.Separate  counter  affidavits  have  been  filed by the
various Estates (i) 12th respondent  (ii)  Respondents  14  to  17  (iii)
Respondents 23  to  26.   The defence taken therein are almost similar to      
that of the counter filed by the Association.   In  addition,  they  have
also pleaded reasons for justifying the downward revision of the wages.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                9.Mr.K.Chandru,    learned   Senior   Counsel   for   the      
petitioners submits that the  proposed  revision  affects  not  only  the
service  conditions,  but  also  the very living conditions of the labour
force in the area.  Cut in the wages and allowances were so drastic  that
it was not possible for the petitioners/workers to survive.  There was no
justification  in  comparing the workers in Nilgiris area as most of them
are natives of the said area while the workers in Anaimalai and  Valparai
areas are migrants from other Districts.  He would also state that if the
very  same  Unions had agreed for the settlement in the Nilgiris area and
they are not agreeing for Valparai area, it cannot be due to any ulterior
motive.  The objections are based only due to peculiar conditions of  one
area and therefore, it was neither proper for comparing one area with the
other  nor to contend that the petitioner's Unions were unnecessarily and
deliberately refusing to arrive at a settlement.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                10.It is further  contended  that  the  existing  service
conditions  as covered by the settlement can be altered only by following
procedure under <a href="/doc/1545865/" id="a_16">Section 19(2)</a> of the Act.  It was the  employer  who  had
given  notice  under  <a href="/doc/50580743/" id="a_17">Section  9-A</a> of the Act and had also approached the
authorities under the Act and had commenced the Conciliation proceedings.
That being so, it was  not  open  for  the  respondents  to  violate  the
provisions  of  <a href="/doc/1951194/" id="a_18">Section 33(1)</a> of the Act and seek to alter the conditions
of service to the disadvantage of the employees during  the  pendency  of
the Conciliation   proceedings.    Such  conduct  not  only  amounted  to
non-compliance of the statutory  provisions,  but  also  attracted  penal
provisions.    Therefore,   respondents  cannot  be  permitted  to  raise       
technical objections such as alternative remedy or the maintainability of
a writ of mandamus. 
</p>
<p id="p_11">                11.Mr.A.L.Somayaji, learned Senior Counsel  for  some  of
the  employers contends that the writ petition itself is not maintainable
as against a Private Company.  It is further stated  that  there  was  no
Conciliation  Proceeding pending as on date, in view of the fact that the
Commissioner had directed bipartite talks among  the  parties  and  talks     
were taking  place.  Hence, Conciliation proceedings have come to an end.
The Conciliation Proceeding was no more subsisting.    The  roll  of  the
Conciliation Officer was only to bring about a settlement and he does not
decide rights  of  parties.    He would further submit that even assuming
that Conciliation was pending, the Unions had the alternative  remedy  of
invoking  <a href="/doc/1980557/" id="a_19">Section  33-A</a>  of  the  Act  to  implement the existing service
conditions or to invoke <a href="/doc/1564754/" id="a_20">Section 33(c)</a> of the Act.  The alleged  violation
of  <a href="/doc/1951194/" id="a_21">Section  33(1)</a>  cannot justify invoking extraordinary jurisdiction of
this Court.  Facts and figures were  also  furnished  by  learned  Senior
Counsel to support the contention that the Plantation industry was facing
a crisis  and  it  was  no more possible to comply with the old wages.  I
would be subsequently dealing with the rulings cited  by  learned  Senior
Counsel in the context of the above submissions.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                12.Mr.Vijay Narayan learned counsel appearing for the PAT
contended  that it was within the rights of the management to give effect
to the changes contemplated under the notice under <a href="/doc/50580743/" id="a_22">Section 9-A</a> of the Act
after notice is given.  The effect of the provision under  <a href="/doc/1951194/" id="a_23">Section  33(1)</a>
of  the  Act has to be considered in the light of the other provisions of
the Act.  The duties of the Conciliation Officer in the context of public
utility services were dealt with under <a href="/doc/642922/" id="a_24">Section 12</a> of the Act.  His duties
in the context of other institutions cannot also vary and  his  duty  was
only  to bring about a settlement if possible and he was not deciding the
rights of parties.  Learned counsel also very  strenuously  pleaded  that
the very survival of the plantations was becoming impossible and in fact,
the  labour  wing were fully aware of the position and that is the reason
why the Union in other areas had come to amicable settlement agreeing for
bringing down the wage structure.  This is not an industry which  can  be
closed  down  or  be subject to lay-off, as in the case of other types of
industries.  Therefore, the labour force should realise that the survival
of both would depend upon each other and being alive to the realities  of
the financial  constraints  on the management.  He would also submit that
notice of Conciliation was not given to the  employers  individually  and
hence,  cannot  be  construed  as  a  Conciliation  proceeding within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/1564754/" id="a_25">Section 33</a> of the Act.  The notice given  to  the  Association
cannot be  construed  as notice to the individual employer.  On the facts
of the  case,  the  Conciliation  Proceedings  cannot  be  said  to  have
commenced.   He  would further submit that even in a case where no notice      
under <a href="/doc/50580743/" id="a_26">Section 9-A</a> of the Act was given, it is  not  in  every  case,  the
Court would  be inclined to interfere.  There is no public duty cast upon
the employer.  The issues are purely contractual.  It is  further  stated
that the negotiations were proceeding in the right direction and if there
should be interruption by the Court now at this stage, it might result in
scuttling an amicable settlement.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                13.Mr.R.T.Doraisamy,  appearing  for  the 12th respondent       
contended  that  the  employees  had  acted  bona  fide   by   initiating     
proceedings for Conciliation and genuine attempts were being made to find
out proper  solution.  It is only a minority section of the employees who
were opposing the settlement.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                14.In  reply,  Mr.K.Chandru,  learned   Senior   Counsel,
contended  that  both  the management and the labour were not at the same 
bargaining level.  The very survival of the workers was at  stakes.    If
certain concessions have been announced in the present Central Budget, it
was due to joint-lobbying with the Government which shows that the labour
was very  much  interested  in  the  survival  of  the  Plantation.   The
management was aiming only at keeping up its  proportion  of  profits  by
reducing  the salary unmindful of the consequential adverse effects which
cannot be borne by the labour.  This  was  a  labour  intensive  industry
which  cannot  contemplate  reduction  of  the work force and that is the
reason why the employers have thought  it  fit  to  cut  down  the  wages 
unmindful of  its  grave effects on the workers.  As regards the issue as
to whether Conciliation Proceedings could be stated to be pending or not,
learned Senior Counsel referred  to  the  pleadings  of  the  respondents
themselves  to  support  his contention that the proceeding was very much       
pending.
</p>

<p id="p_15">                15.I have considered the submissions of  both  sides  and
given my  utmost  consideration.    The  points  for determination can be
broadly formulated as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                (a) Maintainability of the writ petition;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                (b) Alternative remedy and monstrosity of the issue;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                (c) Whether as on date the Conciliation Proceeding is
                pending? </blockquote>
<p id="p_16">                (d)  Whether  the  notice  given  to  the  Association is
sufficient to bind the individual employer/Estate.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                16.MAINTAINABILITY:   
</p><p id="p_18">                The contention that a writ of mandamus cannot  be  issued
as  against a Private Company especially where no public duty is involved
in the discharge of duties, is  mainly  based  on  the  judgment  of  the
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1620518/" id="a_27">V.S.T.INDUSTRIES  LTD.    v.  V.S.T.  INDUSTRIS WORKERS'           
UNION</a> (200  1  (1)  S.C.C.,  298).    Much  reliance  is  placed  on  the
observations  contained  in  paragraph  No.8 of the judgement which is as
follows:
</p><p id="p_19">                "The High Court has relied very strongly on the  decision
of  a learned single Judge in T.GATTAIAH CASE where in it was stated that
a writ may lie under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_28">Article 226</a> of the Constitution  against  a  company
incorporated  under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_29">Companies Act</a>, 1956 as it is permissible to issue
a writ against any person.  Prima facie, therefore, a private  person  or
an   incorporated   company   cannot  be  taken  out  of  the  sweep  and
contemplation of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_30">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.  That decision does not
take note of the fact as to the nature of the functions that a person  or
an  incorporated  company should be performing to attract judicial review
under <a href="/doc/1858991/" id="a_31">Article 26</a> of the Constitution.  In ANANDI MUKTA  CASE  this  Court
examined the various aspects and the distinction between an authority and
a person and after analysis of the decisions referred in that regard came
to the conclusion that it is only in the circumstances when the authority
or the person performs a public function or discharges a public duty that
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_32">Article 226</a> of the Constitution can be invoked.  In the present case, the
appellant   is  engaged  in  the  manufacture  and  sale  of  cigarettes.    
Manufacture and sale of cigarettes will not involve any public  function.
Incidental  to  that  activity there is an obligation under <a href="/doc/663625/" id="a_33">Section 46</a> of
the Act to set up a canteen when the  establishment  has  more  than  250
workmen.   That  means,  it  is  a  condition of service in relation to a           
workman providing better facilities to workmen to discharge their  duties
properly and maintain their own health or welfare.  In other words, it is
only  a  labour  welfare device for the benefit of its workforce unlike a
provision where the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_34">Pollution Control Act</a> makes it obligatory even  on  a
private company not to discharge certain effluents.  In such cases public
duty  is owed to the public in general and not specifically to any person
or group of persons.  Further the damage that  would  be  caused  in  not
observing them  is  immense.  If merely, what can be considered a part of
the conditions of service of a workman is violated then we do  not  think
there  is  any  justification  to  hold that such activity will amount to
public duty.  Thus, we are of the view that  the  High  Court  fell  into
error that the appellant is amenable to writ jurisdiction."
</p>
<p id="p_20">                        17.Mr.A.L.Somayaji,  also  relies  on  few  other
judgments in support of the same contentions.
</p>
<p id="p_21">                        18.The statement of law  thus  expressed  by  the
Supreme Court  in  V.    S.T.INDUSTRIES  case,  supra,  had  already been        
pronounced by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1080534/" id="a_35">PRAGA TOOLS CORPORATION  v.    IMANUAL</a>          
(1969 (2) L.L.J., 749).
</p>
<p id="p_22">                        19.In  that case also, the Supreme Court observed
that mandamus would lie to secure the performance of a statutory duty and
as such the condition precedent for the issue of a mandamus is that there
should be legal right in the petitioner and also could  be  issued  to  a
person  or  to  a  Corporation  to  do a particular thing which is in the
nature of public duty.  Therefore, we have to see whether the  principles

stated in PRAGA TOOLS case, and VST INDUSTRIES case, supra, would nonsuit      
the  petitioners  in  seeking  for direction to the respondents to comply
with their statutory duties and obligations.
</p>
<p id="p_23">                        20.The power of  the  writ  Court  to  issue  the    
prerogative writs  is  well  known.    There  is  no controversy over the
position that it is an extra-ordinary and plenary power to  be  exercised
by  the  Supreme  Court  and  the  High Courts and could be issued to any       
person inclusive of a  private  individual.    Whatever  restrictions  or
embargo  which  are  placed against the exercise of such power are only a      
series of self imposed restrictions which the Courts  have  imposed  upon
themselves considering that it is a discretionary remedy.  Normally writs
will  not  be  issued  in  situations such as availability of alternative
remedy, parties approaching the Court very belatedly, notices  which  are
in  the  nature  of  show-cause  notices,  Executive  functions which are      
administrative and discretionary in nature and based  on  the  subjective
satisfaction of  the  authorities  etc.    Likewise,  for  issuing  writs
positively, notwithstanding any  of  the  above  mentioned  self  imposed
restrictions,  writs  can  be  issued  for  securing ends of justice, the
Executive  Authority  acting  without  application  of  mind  or  without
jurisdiction  and  deliberately  violating statutory obligations and last
but not the least when the action of  respondents  may  be  described  as
"monstrous".   What is to be characterised as monstrous is no doubt to be
left to the judicial conscience in the exercise of its discretion in  the
facts and circumstances of each case.
</p>
<p id="p_24">                        21.The question whether a writ can be issued to a
private  person and a Private Company is positively answered in the above
two judgments themselves relied on by  the  employers  namely,  in  PRAGA  
TOOLS's case  and VST.INDUSTRIES case, supra.  It is made clear that writ 
can be issued to a private individual or a Corporate body or Company  and
such  category of persons need not be discharging any public or statutory
duty.  Distinction is made only on the basis as to whether  the  impugned 
action  of the respondents is in relation to any public duty or statutory
duty.  In VST.INDUSTRIES case, supra,  in  spite  of  the  Supreme  Court
having found that the Company was not involved in any public duty, at the
same  time  made  it  clear  that  if  the same Company was violating the
provisions  of  the  Pollution  control  Act,  a  writ  can  be   issued.       
Therefore, there is no question of any blind or universal embargo against
issuing a  writ  against  a  private  individual  or  a Company.  If they
violate statutory or public duties or indulge  in  monstrous  activities,
writ can be issued.
</p>
<p id="p_25">                        22.While attempting to interpret the judgments of
the  Supreme  Court  in PRAGA TOOLS case, supra, and VST.INDUSTRIES case,       
supra, it is needless to emphasise that the first principle  of  rule  of
precedents  is  that  a decision is an authority for only what it decides
and what it specifically deals with.  The ratio of a decision  cannot  be
operative  to  all  situations  by  ignoring  the background in which the
judgment had been rendered.  It is also settled proposition of law that a
judgment cannot be interpreted as an Act of Legislature, but would govern
only the specific, legal and factual issues dealt with by the judgments.
</p>
<p id="p_26">                        23.In PRAGA TOOLS case, supra,  two  rival  Trade      
Unions  had  executed  two different agreements with the management under 
<a href="/doc/1488438/" id="a_36">Section 18</a> of the Act.  One group of workmen approached  the  High  Court       
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_37">Article 2 26</a> of the Constitution of India questioning the agreement
executed by  the  rival group.  A mandamus was sought for to restrain the 
Company from implementing the agreement.  Needless to say that the  issue 
was  purely  contractual  and  there was no statutory violation much less
transgression of any public  duty.    Likewise  in  VST.INDUSTRIES  case,  
supra,  the  issue was as regards the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_38">Factories Act</a> and
not about the obligations arising under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_39">Industrial Disputes Act</a>.  The
prayer was for a mandamus to treat the employees of the canteen of one of
the factories belonging to the  Company,  as  employees  of  the  Company        
itself.   This  plea  was rejected by the Supreme Court in the context of
<a href="/doc/759329/" id="a_40">Section 46</a> of the Factories Act, 1948 and it was  rightly  held  that  no
public duty was involved in the running of the canteen.  This judgment is
only a restatement of the law on the subject.
</p>
<p id="p_27">                        24.<a href="/doc/793194/" id="a_41">In GENERAL  UNION  v.    K.M.DESAI</a>  (1990  (1)  
L.L.N., 181, a learned single Judge of Bombay High Court  held  that  the
employees  of a canteen under a contractor do not become direct employees 
of the Company. 
</p>
<p id="p_28">                        25.<a href="/doc/1220231/" id="a_42">In WORKMEN OF ASHOK LEYLAND LTD.   v.    ASHOK          
LEYLAND  &amp;  OTHERS</a>  (199 1 (2) L.L.J., 12, a Division Bench of this Court     
held that such employees of the canteen do not become  the  employees  of
the Company or the occupier of the factory.
</p>
<p id="p_29">                        26.In WORKMEN, S.R.F.LTD.   v.    GOVT.  OF TAMIL                  
NADU (1995 (1) L.L.N., 485, again a Division Bench  of  this  Court  held
that  there was no obligation on the part of the industrial establishment
to run a canteen by itself by employing its own workmen.
</p>
<p id="p_30">                        27.<a href="/doc/1220231/" id="a_43">In WORKMEN v.  ASHOK LEYLAND LTD</a>.  (1986  (II)     
L.L.N.,  1035,  it  was held that where a canteen ceased to function as a
result of heavy  loss,  the  factory  was  not  bound  to  re-employ  the
erstwhile employees of the canteen.
</p>
<p id="p_31">                        28.The  above judgments have been rendered in the 
context of the scope of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_44">Factories  Act</a>,1948,  which
is  only a Legislative measure aimed at securing better living conditions
to the worker.  A perusal of the statement of objects and  reasons  shows
that  the  Act  "provides  for  health, safety, welfare, other aspects of
workers in factories." The obligations of the  employer  under  that  Act
cannot  be  over stated or compared with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_45">Industrial
Disputes Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_32">                        29.In  contrast  with  the  provisions   of   the
<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_46">Factories  Act</a>,  the  scope of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_47">Industrial Disputes Act</a> is well-known.
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_48">The Industrial Disputes Act</a> deals with the basic obligations, fundamental
rights,  duties,  obligations  and  liabilities  of   both   labour   and
management.   The  scope  of  disputes  involve not only that of a single
individual worker and the management alone.    With  the  recognition  of
Trade  Unions  and  their  rights to raise disputes in the context of not
only individual grievances, but also collective demands and grievances of
large number of workers, the issues have impact on the industrial  peace,
law and order, productivity and consequent wastage and thus affect public
interest to a very great extent.
</p>
<p id="p_33">                        30.The  public  interest  involved  in the issues
covered under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_49">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a>  has  been  very  effectively
stated  by  the  Constitution  Bench of the Supreme Court 50 years ago in
<a href="/doc/1785601/" id="a_50">D.N.BANERJI v.  P.R.  MUKHERJEE</a> (A.I.R.1953 S.C., 58) as follows:          
"It is therefore incumbent on us to ascertain what the statute  means  by 
"industry"  and  "industrial dispute", leaving aside the original meaning
attributed to the words in a simpler state of society, when we  had  only
one  employer  perhaps,  doing  a  particular  trade  or  carrying  on  a        
particular business with the help of his own tools material and skill and
employing a few workmen in the process of production or manufacture,  and
when such disputes that occurred did not go behind individual levels into
acute  fights  between  rival organisations of workmen and employers, and
when large scale strikes and lock-outs throwing society  into  chaos  and
confusion  were practically unknown Legislation had to keep pace with the
march of times and to provide for new situations.  Social evolution is  a
process  of  constant  growth, and the State cannot afford to stand still   
without taking adequate measures by means of legislation to  solve  large
and momentous problems that arise in the industrial field from day to day
almost."
</p>

<p id="p_34">                31.If the introduction of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_51">Industrial Disputes Act</a> was
a  product  of  social evolution and was meant to meet the changes in the
society, throwing society into chaos and confusion, I fail to  appreciate
how  to  term  the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_52">Industrial Disputes Act</a> as a mere legislation dealing
with only personal or individual rights and to hold that no  public  duty
was involved in the proceedings under the Act.  It is true that in a case
of  a  dispute  between  a  single  workman and the management, no public         
interest would be involved.  But in a case of  the  present  type,  which
involves  the  question  of  wages  due  to  thousands of workers and the
potential dangers  to  which  the  society  would  be  exposed  if  their
grievances  are  not  sorted  out,  definitely  the  issue affects public
interest and a corresponding public duty is cast upon both the management
and the labour to ensure public peace.  It is also a  fact  that  on  the
very  same issue, peace, law and order in the areas where the Tea estates
are located have been greatly affected and public peace, tranquility  had
been very  much  disturbed.  The public interest and public duty involved    
is as much as that of violation of the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_53">Pollution Control Act</a>,  which  has
been  pointed out by the Supreme Court as an instance which would justify
invocation of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_54">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of  India,  notwithstanding
the  fact  that  the  respondent may be only a private individual and not
being involved in the discharge of any public duty,  vide  VST.INDUSTRIES
case.
</p>
<p id="p_35">                32.In  the  very  same judgment of the Constitution Bench
cited above, the Supreme Court went further to point out that  industrial
disputes  could  affect  large groups of workmen and employees arrayed on 
opposite sides on certain common issues such as wages,  bonus  etc.,  and       
observed as follows:-
</p><p id="p_36">"Such  widespread extension of labour unrest is not a rare phenomenon but
is of frequent occurrence.  In such a case, even an industrial dispute in
a particular business becomes a large scale industrial dispute, which the
Government cannot afford to ignore as  a  minor  trouble  to  be  settled
between particular employer and workman." 
</p>
<p id="p_37">                33.<a href="/doc/387600/" id="a_55">In BALLARPUR COLLIERIES  CO.    v.  PRESIDING OFFICER,          
DHANBAD</a> (1972 (2) S.C.C.,27), the Supreme Court dealt with the  scope  of        
the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_56">Industrial Disputes Act</a> and held as follows:-
</p><p id="p_38">"In  this  connection  it  has  to  be  borne in mind that proceedings of
industrial adjudication are not considered as proceedings purely  between
two private  parties  having  no  impact  on  the industry as such.  Such
proceedings involve larger public interest in which the industry as  such
(including the  employer  and  the  labour)  is  vitally interested.  The
scheme  of  the  law  of  industrial  adjudication  designed  to  promote   
industrial  peace  and harmony so as to incre ase production and help the
growth and progress of national economy  has  to  be  considered  in  the     
background  of our constitutional set-up according to which the State has
to strive to secure and effectively  protect  a  social  order  in  which
social,  economic  and  political justice must inform all institutions of
national life  and  the  material  resources  of  the  community  are  so
distributed as best to sub-serve the common good."
</p>
<p id="p_39">                34.This  is  precisely  the  situation  now  faced in the
present case and therefore, I find it difficult to accept the contentions
that <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_57">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India cannot be  invoked  and  no
mandamus can be issued.   
</p>
<p id="p_40">                35.   For the very same reasons, as above, I am unable to
accept the comparison which Mr.A.L.Somayaji was drawing  as  regards  the       
Rent  Control  Act,  namely,  if  every statutory violation could justify
invocation of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_58">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, then  a  landlord
or  a tenant could do so complaining that the opposite party had violated
the provisions of the Rent Control Act.  Firstly, the wider and pervasive
nature of the disputes under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_59">Industrial Disputes Act</a>  had  been  very
succinctly described  by  the  Constitution  Bench  as  above.   The Rent
Control Act which  deals  with  the  individual  and  mutual  contractual
obligations between one landlord and one tenant (or at the most a five or
six  tenants)  cannot  at  all  be  compared  with  the range of disputes
contemplated under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_60">Industrial Disputes Act</a>.  Secondly, I had  already
mentioned  that in a given case a dispute raised by a single worker or as
against the single worker, public interest or public  duty  will  not  be
involved.   But  in  the  present  case, we are confronted with a dispute
between thousands of workers and about 30 Tea Estates. 
</p>
<p id="p_41">                36.  A Division Bench of this Court when confronted  with
similar objections  in  <a href="/doc/1121497/" id="a_61">MADRAS  LABOUR  UNION v.  BINNY LIMITED</a> (1995 (1)                  
C.T.C.,73) had dealt with the issue in detail with reference  to  several
rulings of the Supreme Court and had ultimately concluded that a mandamus 
can be issued as against a private body in the context of gross violation
of  statute  or  public  duty  and  if the monstrosity of the facts would
justify intervention by the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_42">                37.Therefore, I am inclined to hold that the  above  writ
petitions are maintainable and the judgment in VST.INDUSTRIES case supra,  
does not  in any manner affect the facts of the case.  On the other hand,
the said judgment is positive that a writ can be issued even as against a
private individual the impugned issue relates to a public duty or  public
interest.
</p>
<p id="p_43">                38.ALTERNATE REMEDY AND MONSTROSITY OF THE ISSUE The               
issue  of  alternate  remedy is inter related with the monstrosity of the
issue and would also be relevant for the issue of  maintainability  which
has been considered above.  Both Mr.A.L.Somayaji and Mr.Vijay Narayan had  
emphasised  at  length  that  the  forums  constituted under the act were
effective remedies and as such writ petitions cannot be entertained.   It
is  further  stated  that  <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_62">Section 33-A</a> of the Act entitles the aggrieved
party to complain against violation of <a href="/doc/886678/" id="a_63">Section 33(1)(a)</a> of the Act and as
such the petitioners were not entitled to invoke the  writ  jurisdiction.
It  is  true  that <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_64">Section 33-A</a> of the Act deals with the situation of an
employer contravening the provisions of <a href="/doc/1774629/" id="a_65">Section 33</a> of the Act during  the
pendency of  the  proceedings  before  the authorities under the Act.  An
employee aggrieved by the contravention may make a complaint  in  writing
to the concerned authority and such authority shall adjudicate upon it as
if it were a dispute pending before it.  To appreciate this objection, it
is necessary to extract <a href="/doc/1544515/" id="a_66">Section 33(1)</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_44">"33.Conditions of  service,  etc.    To  remain  unchanged  under certain        
circumstances during pendency of proceedings 
(1)During  the  pendency  of  any  conciliation   proceeding   before   a
conciliation  officer  or  a  Board  or  of  any  proceeding  before  (an
arbitrator or) a Labour Court or Tribunal or National Tribunal in respect

</p><p id="p_45">(a)     in regard to any matter connected with the dispute, alter, to the

</p><p id="p_46">(b)     for any misconduct  connected  with  the  dispute,  discharge  or

</p>
<p id="p_47">                39.<a href="/doc/1544515/" id="a_67">Section 33(1)</a> makes it mandatory that during  pendency 
of  the  proceedings  under  the  Act, the existing conditions of service
shall not be altered to the disadvantage of the employee  save  with  the
express   permission  in  writing  of  the  authority  before  which  the 
proceeding is pending.  If there  is  violation  of  the  said  mandatory 
requirement  then  the  employee  has the right to complain under <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_68">Section
33-A</a> of the Act which will  be  treated  as  a  dispute  and  dealt  with
accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_48">                40.To  appreciate  the  objections  of the respondents as
regards this contention, it is necessary  to  recall  the  background  in
which the issue went before the Conciliation Officer after issuing notice
to the  Unions  under  <a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_69">Section  9-A</a>  of the Act.  The first respondent by
their  letter  to  the  Joint  Commissioner  of  Labour  Chennai,   dated        
29.11.2001  informed  the  issue  of notice under <a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_70">Section 9-A</a> of the Act.
The Joint Commissioner, Coimbatore, on receipt of the said notice by  his
letter  dated  7.12.2001  informed  the  first  respondent as well as the
Labour Unions that negotiations will take place before  the  Commissioner 
of  Labour  on  18.12.2001  and that the said notice was sent in terms of
<a href="/doc/1949741/" id="a_71">Section 12(1)</a> of the Act and Rules 23 and 37 of the  Industrial  Disputes
Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_49">                41.It  is  very important to bear in mind that it was the
employer who chose to raise  the  dispute  and  it  is  expected  of  the
management to adhere to the statutory obligations under <a href="/doc/1774629/" id="a_72">Section 33</a> of the
Act  in  terms  of  which  the employer shall not be entitled to vary the
existing terms of employment to the disadvantage of  the  workers.    The
rights  of the workers thus incorporated under <a href="/doc/1774629/" id="a_73">Section 33</a> of the Act is a
very valuable right and imposes a duty on the employer not to  alter  the
conditions of service.
</p>
<p id="p_50">                42.The  right  of  the worker under <a href="/doc/1774629/" id="a_74">Section 33</a> of the Act
should also be viewed along side their right to go on a lawful strike  by
complying  with  the  provisions  of the Act and the conditions envisaged
thereunder.  It is a right which is statutorily recognised and  does  not
require  citing  a plethora of precedents in support of the said accepted
rights of the workers and the right of the employer to resort to a lawful
lock-out.  But <a href="/doc/1950513/" id="a_75">Sections 22</a> and <a href="/doc/708192/" id="a_76">23</a> of the Act place an embargo on  such  a
right under  the circumstances specified thereunder.  While <a href="/doc/1950513/" id="a_77">Section 22</a> of
the Act deals with strike  and  lock  out  in  public  utility  services,
<a href="/doc/708192/" id="a_78">Section 23</a> deals with general prohibition of strikes and lock-out.
</p>
<p id="p_51">                43.<a href="/doc/708192/" id="a_79">Section  23</a>  of  the  Act  prohibits  workmen going on 
strike during the pendency  of  Conciliation  proceedings  or  a  dispute
before   the   Labour  Court,  Industrial  Tribunal  or  the  Arbitration
proceedings and during any period  when  a  settlement  or  award  is  in      
operation.  In the present case, the period of settlement is over and the
management  not  being  satisfied by expressing their intention to reduce     
the wages by issuing statutory notice, had  also  initiated  Conciliation
proceedings before the Commissioner, thereby depriving the valuable right
of  the  workers  to resort to a legal strike which is the only method of
their exercising the bargaining power.  At the same time, the  management  
will not also condescend to move the appropriate authority for permission
and  would  violate the mandate that they should not alter the conditions
of service to the detriment of the employees resulting in  the  following
series  of consequences, thus pushing the workers into an inequitable and
unfairly disadvantageous position as follows:-
</p><p id="p_52">        (a)Giving notice for reducing the existing wage  structure  which
itself is a justifiable grievance for the workers which ought not to have
been resorted to except by way of settlement or by an award.
</p><p id="p_53">        (b)Not seeking permission before the Conciliation Officer to vary
the  terms  of  service  thereby  intentionally  violating  mandate under
<a href="/doc/1081292/" id="a_80">Section 31(1)</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_54">        (c)Having failed  to  comply  with  the  requirement  of  seeking
permission under <a href="/doc/1544515/" id="a_81">Section 33(1)</a> of the Act raising an untenable contention
that  the  workers,  if  they wish they may raise a dispute under <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_82">Section
33-A</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_55">        (d)If the workers in a helpless situation invoke jurisdiction  of
this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_83">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, the management
raising a contention that the writ is not maintainable.
</p><p id="p_56">        (e)Having   themselves   initiated  a  dispute,  raising  further
untenable technical contentions regarding the pendency of the dispute and
the individual estates not being a party etc., which have  neither  legal
nor moral basis as explained below.
</p>
<p id="p_57">                44.The  above  mentioned series of conduct on the part of
the management would be sufficient to indicate not only the  unreasonable
attitude  of  the  employers,  but also the "monstrosity" of the existing
situation.  Reducing the existing wage structure is itself an unusual and
rare feature to be proposed by the management considering the  spiralling
cost of  living.    I  do  not  propose  to  say that such a variation is     
impermissible, but is a rare proposal which could be  justified  only  by
adducing   proper   and  convincing  materials  before  the  authorities.
Therefore, to reduce the wages to which the workers  are  accustomed  to,
without even seeking the statutory permission from the authorities before
whom  the  dispute  is  pending as required under the Act, would be in my
opinion sufficient to estop the management from raising the contention of
alternate remedy.
</p>
<p id="p_58">                45.The necessity of seeking permission of  the  authority
during  the  pendency  of  the  dispute  is a mandatory requirement and a
precondition before the management could seek to alter the conditions  of
service.  It  is  intended  to  maintain  status  quo.  In PUNJ.N.BANK v.  
A.I.P.N.   B.E.FEDERATION  (A.I.R.1980  S.C.,  160),  the  Supreme  Court       
highlighted the mandatory nature of the ban as follows:-
"The object  of  the Legislature in enacting this section is obvious.  By
imposing the ban  S.33  attempts  to  provide  for  the  continuance  and
termination   of   the  pending  proceedings  in  a  peaceful  atmosphere       
undisturbed by any causes  of  friction  between  the  employer  and  his       
employees.   In  substance  it insists upon the maintenance of the status
quo pending the disposal of the industrial dispute between  the  parties;
nevertheless it recognises that occasions may arise when the employer may 
be  justified in discharging or punishing by dismissal his employees, and
so it allows the employer to take such action subject  to  the  condition
that  before doing so he must obtain the express permission in writing of
the Tribunal.  It is true that the ban is  imposed  in  terms  which  are
mandatory  and  S.31(1) makes the contravention of the provisions of S.33
an offence punishable as prescribed therein."
</p>
<p id="p_59">                46.It is true that <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_84">Section 33-A</a> entitles the  workmen  to
raise a  complaint.  Reliance is placed on the following judgments by the
employers in support of their contention that the workers  should  resort
to  that  remedy,  which are in my opinion not applicable to the facts of
the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_60">                47.In SREE SEETHA VENKATESH MILLS EMP.  <a href="/doc/615307/" id="a_85">UNION v.    GOVT.

Bench in Writ Appeal No.151 of 2001).    F.M.Ibrahim  Kalifulla,J.    was
confronted  with  the  situation  where  the Conciliation proceedings had
ended in a failure report and no reference had been made  to  the  Labour
Court.   It  is  at that stage, the Union filed the writ petition praying
for the issue of a writ of mandamus to direct the Government to refer the
dispute for adjudication and in the mean time to direct the  employer  to
maintain status  quo.   In other words, it was a case where no proceeding
was pending before any of the authorities under the  Act  when  the  writ
petition was resorted to.
</p>
<p id="p_61">                48.The  judgment  of  another  Division  Bench  in GORDON   
WOODROFFE EMP.  <a href="/doc/615307/" id="a_86">UNION v.  STATE OF T.N</a>.   (1988  (I)  L.L.N.,  196)  also            
arose under the same circumstances, namely, the Conciliation had ended in
failure and the Union came forward with a writ to prohibit the management
from altering  the  conditions  of service.  Therefore, the said judgment
also will not apply.
</p>
<p id="p_62">                49.Both the decisions  as  aforementioned  are  perfectly
understandable  having  regard  to <a href="/doc/63501/" id="a_87">Section 20</a> of the Act which deals with
commencement and conclusion of the proceedings.  Under <a href="/doc/307924/" id="a_88">Section  20(2)</a>  of       
the  Act,  a  conciliation  proceeding  shall be deemed to have concluded 
where no settlement is arrived at and when the report of the Conciliation
Officer is received by the appropriate Government.  Therefore,  when  the
writ  petitions  were  filed  in  those  cases, no proceeding was pending 
before any authority.

</p><p id="p_64">932) also deals with a case under different  circumstances.    The  Union
filed the writ petition for the issue of a writ of mandamus to direct the
Conciliation  Officer  to  complete  the  proceedings and also sought for
interim injunction restraining the employer from shifting  the  machinery 
or transferring the employees.  The Division Bench held on facts that the
attempt  on  the  part  of the Union was premature and also amounted to a         
plea to maintain status quo ante.  The Division Bench did not go into the
issue of the obligations of the management to move the authority to grant
permission to alter the conditions of service.  On facts also it was held
that there was no monstrous situation requiring the intervention  of  the
Court.
</p>
<p id="p_65">                51.The nature and scope of the enquiry under <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_90">Section 33-A</a>
of  the  Act,  would in my opinion render the provision as an ineffective
remedy and cannot be pleaded an effective alternative  remedy  so  as  to
prevent  the  Union to seek for the issue of a writ of mandamus to compel
the employer to comply  with  the  mandatory  requirement  under  <a href="/doc/1544515/" id="a_91">Section
33-(1)</a> of  the  Act.    Resort to <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_92">Section 33-A</a> of the Act is nothing more
than a fresh reference and another dispute and is not an effective remedy
to maintain the status quo.  In  the  following  judgments,  the  Supreme 
Court had clearly held that the proceedings under <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_93">Section 33-A</a> of the Act
is  not different from a dispute arising out of a reference under <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_94">Section
10</a> of the Act.  For instance, in the case of dismissal of an employee  in
contravention of <a href="/doc/1774629/" id="a_95">Section 33</a> of the Act, on a complaint under <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_96">Section 33-A</a>
of  the  Act,  the  Tribunal  has  to  separately  deal with not only the
question of contravention, but also  the  merits  of  the  order  of  the
dismissal.
</p><p id="p_66">(i)PUNJ.N.BANK v.  A.I.P.N.B.E.FEDERATION (A.I.R 1960 S.C., 160);

</p><p id="p_68">(iii)BHAVNAGAR MUNICIPALITY v.  A.KARIMBAI (1977 (34) F.L.R., 279).         
Therefore,  resort  to <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_98">Section 33-A</a> of the Act is not at all an effective
or an alternate remedy.  It is in fact more complicated and long  winding
than the  main  dispute  itself  which  is  awaiting  adjudication.   The
management which intentionally and with impunity violates  <a href="/doc/1544515/" id="a_99">Section  33(1)</a>
of  the  Act  cannot be heard to plead that <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_100">Section 33-A</a> of the Act is an
effective alternative remedy.  The object of invocation of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_101">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution of India in a monstrous situation is intended to  secure
timely justice and a p lea of alternative remedy cannot be entertained at
the instance of a defaulting party.
</p>
<p id="p_69">                52.The  more  appropriate ruling in this context would be
the latest judgment of a Constitutional Bench of  the  Supreme  Court  in
JAIPUR ZILA SAHAKARI BHOOMI VIKAS BANK LTD.  v RAM GOPAL SHARMA (2002 (2)               
S.C.C., 244).    In  that  case, the Supreme Court dealt with a provision
similar to <a href="/doc/1544515/" id="a_102">Section 33(1)</a> of the Act namely, <a href="/doc/1774629/" id="a_103">Section 33</a> (2)(b) of the  Act
which  requires  the  management to seek for approval of the discharge or
dismissal of an employee during the pendency of  the  proceedings.    The
management  took  the stand that the Union can only raise another dispute
or forward a complaint under <a href="/doc/1081292/" id="a_104">Section 31(1)</a> or  33-a  of  the  Act.    The
Constitution  Bench came down heavily on such a plea and held that such a
person who contravenes the provision "cannot be rewarded by relieving him
of the statutory obligations created on him to make such an application."
The Supreme Court went further to observe as follows:-
"<a href="/doc/1701494/" id="a_105">Section 31</a> speaks of penalty in respect of the offences stated  therein.
This  provision  is  not  intended  to  give  any  remedy to an aggrieved
employee.  It is only to punish the offender.  The argument that  <a href="/doc/1701494/" id="a_106">Section
31</a>  provides  a  remedy to an employee for contravention of <a href="/doc/1774629/" id="a_107">Section 33</a> is
unacceptable.  Merely because penal provision is available or  a  workman
has  a  further  remedy  under  <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_108">Section  33-A</a>  to  challenge the approval              
granted, it cannot be said that the order of discharge or dismissal  does
not  become  inoperative  or invalid unless set aside under <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_109">Section 33-A</a>.
There is nothing in <a href="/doc/1701494/" id="a_110">Sections 31</a>,<a href="/doc/1774629/" id="a_111">33</a> and <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_112">33-A</a>  to  suggest  otherwise  even
reading them  together  in  the  context.  These sections are intended to
serve different purposes."
</p><p id="p_70">                53.My conclusions as above are  therefore,  fortified  by
the  observations  of the Constitution Bench and the plea of <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_113">Section 33-A</a>
as being an alternate remedy cannot be sustained, more so in a case where
it is the management which went before the Conciliation Officer.    I  am
inclined  to  hold  that  the facts stated above and the situation having
been brought about by the management itself, are more than sufficient  to
hold  that  the  situation  is  a  monstrous  one  enough  to  invoke the
jurisdiction of this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_71">                54.As regards alternate remedy,  it  is  also  a  settled
proposition  of  law  that  it  is  only a rule of policy convenience and
discretion and not one of bar of jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_114">Article  226</a>  of  the
Constitution  of  India,  vide  the judgment of the Constitution Bench in
<a href="/doc/1590667/" id="a_115">U.P.STATE v.  MOHMMAD NOOH</a> (A.I.R.  1958 S.C., 86)

pending:
</p><p id="p_73">                The  contention on behalf of the respondents is that as a
result of the Commissioner of Labour having suggested  the  issue  to  be
discussed  between  the  Union and the Planter's Association by bilateral     
talks, the process of conciliation is over and does not subsist any more.
The role of the Conciliation Officer is only to  mediate  and  he  cannot
decide the rights of the parties.  Therefore, in directing the parties to
negotiate  between  themselves,  the Conciliation Proceeding is deemed to
have come to an end. 
</p>
<p id="p_74">                56.I am unable to accept the aforesaid contention.    The
Commissioner,  after sending the letter dated 7.12.2001, calling upon all
the  parties  to  attend  the  Conciliation  on  18.12.2001,   admittedly
proceeded with  the  Conciliation  talks.    The suggestion for bipartite
talks is nothing more than an  attempt  to  facilitate  both  parties  to
narrow  down  the area of difference and such a step or suggestion cannot
be deemed as abandoning  or  closing  the  Conciliation  or  Conciliation      
Officer loosing  his  jurisdiction.  It is nothing more than a Court or a
Tribunal, adjourning the hearing to enable  the  parties  to  come  to  a
settlement.  In fact, that is how the employers themselves had understood
the issue.    By  letter 29.12.2001 the Planters Association had reported
about the progress of bipartite talks and that further  discussions  were
to continue  on  4.10.2001.    This  was followed by similar letter dated
7.1.2002.  The Commissioner by his letter dated 11.1.2002, had asked  the
Association  to  intimate  the  present  stage  of the bilateral talks by     
return fax in order  to  proceed  further  in  the  matter.    There  was
absolutely no need for either the Commissioner or the Association to have
gone   through   such   correspondence,  if  the  Conciliation  had  been         
terminated.  This was followed by  a  series  of  similar  letters  dated
12.1.2002,   15.1.200   2,  19.1.2002,  25.1.2002,  31.1.2002,  5.2.2002,
14.2.2002 and 22.2.2002 to the Commissioner stating that the  talks  were
in   progress   and   further   developments  will  be  reported  to  the
Commissioner.  If the Conciliation was closed, there was no need for such
an exercise.  In the mean time, the Association also addressed  a  letter
to  the  Collector, Coimbatore, requesting the District Administration to
give protection to maintain law and order.  The District Collector by his
letter dated 6.2.2002, had in  fact  referred  to  the  pendency  of  the
Conciliation proceedings before the Commissioner of Labour and as such no
unilateral change can be effected by the planters and that therefore, the
members of  the  Association  may  not  precipitate  this  issue.    I am    
referring to this letter only to the limited  extent  as  reflecting  the
factual position  of  the  pendency of the Conciliation proceedings.  The
PAT did not  raise  a  contention  that  conciliation  was  not  pending.
Therefore,  the  mere  circumstance of the parties having been allowed to
hold  talks  between  themselves  cannot  result   in   terminating   the
Conciliation proceedings.   In fact as referred to earlier, under <a href="/doc/63501/" id="a_116">Section
20</a> of the Act, a Conciliation proceeding can be stated to have  concluded 
only  where settlement is arrived at and signed by the parties or when no


settlement is arrived at, and the  failure  report  is  received  by  the
appropriate Government.      There   is  no  other  process  by  which  a        
Conciliation proceeding can be stated to have concluded.
</p>
<p id="p_75">                57.Apart from the aforesaid circumstances, a  perusal  of
the  counter  affidavits filed by the respondents themselves disclose how
they themselves have understood about  the  position.    In  the  counter
affidavit,  it  is  admitted  that  the respondents had given a letter to
initiate Conciliation proceedings.  In fact the very  pleading  that  the
Union should have invoked a complaint under <a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_117">Section 33-A</a> of the Act leads
to  the  presumption  about the pendency of the Conciliation proceedings.
If no proceeding is pending, then there is  no  possibility  of  invoking
<a href="/doc/365858/" id="a_118">Section 33-A</a> of the Act at all.
</p>
<p id="p_76">                58.Therefore, it is not possible to accept the contention
that the Conciliation proceeding is not pending.
</p>
<p id="p_77">                59.  WHETHER NOTICE GIVEN TO THE P.A.T.  IS SUFFICIENT TO          
BIND THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYER/ESTATE?         
</p><p id="p_78">        This  point  is  urged  by  the respondents/employers again in an
attempt to wriggle out of the situation which they themselves created  by
having initiated  Conciliation  proceedings.  I do not find any basis for
this objection.  It is pertinent to  note  that  all  the  employers  are
members of the PAT.  This position is not in dispute.  All the talks have
been proceeding  only  with PAT and not with the individual planters.  It   
is most important to note that agreements or settlements have  also  been
entered into  only  by  PAT as representing the planters.  In fact, it is
the PAT which had  given  notice  under  <a href="/doc/325738/" id="a_119">Section  19(2)</a>  of  the  Act  to
terminate  the  continued  operation of the existing settlement after its
expiry on 31.12.2001.  It is only on the advise of PAT the format of  the
notice  under  <a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_120">Section 9-A</a> of the Act as prescribed by the PAT vide their
letter dated 29.11.2001 was sent to the individual employers as  well  as
to  the  Joint  Commissioner,  Labour,  and  thus  the  conciliation  was
initiated.  The process of  negotiation  commenced  with  PAT  writing  a
letter  to  the  Hon'ble  Minister  for  Labour  which  was  followed  by        
subsequent talks with him.    A  perusal  of  the  notice  given  by  the
employers  for  change of service condition also discloses that reference
is made only to the agreement arrived at by the PAT on their  behalf  and
PAT  having  given notice of termination on 24.10.2001 on behalf of their
members/estates.  Therefore, the role played by PAT was  well  understood       
by the PAT as well as the individual estates.
</p>
<p id="p_79">                60.The most crucial feature is the notice of Conciliation
which  was  sent  by  the Joint Commissioner on 7.12.2001 only to the PAT
under <a href="/doc/1949741/" id="a_121">Section 12(1)</a> of the Act read with Rules 23 and  37  of  the  Tamil
Nadu Rules.    Rule  23  of the Rules enables the Conciliation Officer to
intimate  to  the  parties  declaring  his  intention  to  commence   the
Conciliation proceedings.    Rule  37  deals  with  service of summons or
notice where there are numerous persons as parties to the proceedings and
when such persons are members of the any Trade Union or Association,  the 
service  of  notice on the Secretary or the Principal Office of the Union
or Association shall be deemed to be service on such  persons.    Such  a
service  shall  also  be  considered as sufficient in the case of parties
represented by such Unions or Associations.
</p>
<p id="p_80">                61.It  is  pertinent  to  note  that  neither   PAT   nor
individual  employer  at  any time raised any demur when the Commissioner
sent his notice only to PAT specifically quoting  Rules  23  and  37  nor
during discussions  with him.  The negotiations have been taking place on
numerous occasions to the knowledge of the individual employers only with
the PAT representing all the employers.  Therefore, the  present  defence
which is now taken only in these writ petitions by PAT and the individual
estates, is not at all fair.
</p>


<p id="p_81">                62.Mr.Vijay Narayan was at pains to emphasise that in the
absence  of  individual authorisation by the members, the PAT cannot be a      
properly constituted representative.  Reliance  is  placed  on  Rule  46.
Rule  46  is  in  relation  to a worker or workers authorising another to
represent him or them.  The said Rule can have no relevance to  a  notice
which had  been issued under Rule 37.  An argument was also advanced that 
Rule 37 may not strictly apply to the employers, but would apply only  to
the Trade  Unions.    I  am  afraid  that  there  is  no basis for such a
distinction.
</p>
<p id="p_82">                63.As stated earlier, it is the PAT which has always been
negotiating with the Unions, executing agreements, holding talks with the
Minister after the present dispute arose and the Commissioner  of  Labour
and  corresponding  with  the  Commissioner  on behalf of the estates and
corresponding with the District Collector at all stages.  Therefore,  the
defence now raised is obviously resorted to as a desperate remedy without
basis.
</p>
<p id="p_83">                64.The  very  claim  by  the  employers  that the earlier
settlements are no more effective and not binding on them is based on the
notice issued by PAT under <a href="/doc/325738/" id="a_122">Section 19(2)</a> on 24.10.2001.   Agreements  are        
executed with  PAT  only and notice of termination is issued by PAT.  PAT
initiates conciliation proceeding and conciliation is proceeded with only
PAT representing all the estates.  No objection is raised at any stage by
PAT or the individual employer that PAT is not representing them,  or  by
the PAT that they are not representing the individual Estates.
</p>
<p id="p_84">                65.In conclusion, I find  that  the  writ  petitions  are
maintainable and  the petitioners are entitled to the relief.  It is true
that the difficulties expressed  by  both  Mr.A.L.Somayaji  and  Mr.Vijay
Narayan,  on  behalf of the Estates regarding the problems experienced by
the Plantation Industry may be correct to a  considerable  extent.    But
when  the statute requires that the existing service conditions cannot be
altered to the disadvantage of the workers without a  written  permission
from  the authorities before whom the proceeding is pending, the employer
cannot be heard to violate the same  and  to  drive  the  workers  to  an
inequitable position.    It  is  only to enable the employer to alter the
conditions of service even  during  the  pendency  of  the  dispute,  the
employer  is  given the liberty and statutory right to move the authority
for the said purpose.  When such a petition is filed,  the  authority  is
bound to pass a considered order by taking into account all the materials
and circumstances objectively.  The authority would be performing a quasi
judicial  function  and  therefore, bound to pass a reasoned order and if
the PAT has enough materials to substantiate their claims, there need not
be any hesitation on their part.  The fact that the Unions in other areas
had come to amicable settlement will also be  an  added  ground  for  the      
employer  to justify their proposed action which cannot be ignored by the
authority without proper material.  When the statute prescribes a certain
mode or procedure, the party who is  obliged  to  comply  with  the  same 
cannot be heard to violate the same and plead otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_85">                66.Therefore, the above writ petitions are  allowed  with
liberty   to  the  respondents  to  move  the  Conciliation  Officer  for
permission under <a href="/doc/1544515/" id="a_123">Section 33(1)</a> of the Act before altering the  conditions
of  service  and  till then, the respondents are bound to comply with the
existing terms of the service conditions.  No costs.  Connected  W.P.M.Ps  
are closed as unnecessary.
