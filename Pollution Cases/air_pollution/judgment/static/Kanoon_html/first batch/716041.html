                          O R D E R
</pre>
<p id="p_1">    (Order of the Court was made by S.J.MUKHOPADHAYA, J.)



      The  Writ  petition was filed in public  interest  for

forbearing the  respondents from storage, transport of  coal

from or through Vadalur, Cuddalore District.
</p>


<p id="p_2">       2.    According  to  the  writ  petitioner,  the  7th

respondent-The  Chettinad Lignite Transport  Services  Ltd.,

Vadalur,  extracts  lignite from  mine  1A  of  the  Neyveli

Lignite  Corporation (NLC) and transport the same to Vadalur

Railway  Station, wherefrom the coal is transported  to  the

6th respondent-The STCMS Electric Company (P) Ltd., Chennai.
</p>
<p id="p_3">There  are more than 100 families reside in Sarvodaya  Nagar

near  the  Vadalur  Railway Station.  The operation  of  the

lignite depot at Vadalur results in high levels of suspended

and  respirable  particulate matter being  generated  during

various points such as, transport from the mine, storage  at

the  bunker  unit  at  Vadalur and transportation  from  the

bunker to the silo by conveyance and transport from the silo

to  the  zero  unit.  Apart from high risk to  the  ecology,

there  is  also a high risk of serious human health  impacts

likely  to  be caused.  The bunker is situated in  an  area,

where  there are more than 2400 houses assessed to  property

tax.    There   are  many  more  hutments  and  low   income

residential housing in the area.   The health impacts extend

to  over 40,000 people reside in and around Vadalur and over

25  villages, situate in the neighbourhood.   The  grievance

of  the  petitioner  is  that  the  first  respondent  while

granting  clearance  to  the  Power  Plant,  was  under  the

impression  that  the  transport of  coal  by  road  through

lorries  would  be  with adequate dust  suppression  measure

adoption.   This appears to be the claim in the  Environment

Impact Assessment.  The matter having come to the notice  of

the  petitioner, has alleged that though he represented  the

matter  to  the  Government of Tamil Nadu on  23.9.2002,  no

action was taken.
</p>


<p id="p_4">       3.    During  pendency  of  the  writ  petition,  the

petitioner filed an affidavit wherein it is alleged that  he

could learn that the 6th respondent Company, though obtained

consent  for establishment of the Unit in the year 1998  and

commenced  production activity in the year 2002,  no  public

hearing  or Environment Impact Assessment was conducted  for

the entire project.
</p>


<p id="p_5">     4.   The 7th respondent-The Chettinad Lignite Transport

Services  (P) Ltd., Vadalur, who is in fact the  Transporter

of  lignite  from  Neyveli  to  Vadalur,  while  denied  the

allegation, has taken the plea that adequate safeguards have

been  taken to protect from any Environmental hazards  apart

from  other  steps taken for transportation of lignite  from

Neyvely  to  Vadalur to prevent any pollution.  The  lignite

has  very high moisture content and is not prone to fugitive

emissions.    NLC  has  been transporting  lignite  in  open

conveyors  eversince the inception for several decades,  but

the 7th respondent has been transporting lignite from NLC in

trucks, which are properly covered and sealed by tarpaulins.
</p>
<p id="p_6">The  trucks  move  along the road in the  NLC  land  to  the

underground bunker, where the lignite is unloaded.  A forced

jet  spray  of  water through nozzle has been  installed  to

suppress emanation of any dust particles. The spray of water

is  inter-locked with dumping platform of the bunker so that

it  gets  activated during unloading of lignite from trucks.
</p>
<p id="p_7">The  lignite,  which  is unloaded, is transferred  from  the

bunkers  to the silos by covered conveyors.  These conveyors

are  covered on all sides.  Water is sprayed through nozzles

at  transfer  points in the conveyors for dust  suppression.
</p>
<p id="p_8">Any  emission  from  each storage  silos  is  taken  to  the

respective  bag  filters that can filter particles  upto  60

microns  size.   The clean, filtered and dust  free  air  is

released into the atmosphere.  It is from the silos that the

lignite  is loaded into the railway wagons and other actions

are taken.  The following steps seems to have been taken  by

the 7th respondent:
</p>


<p id="p_9">(a)   Providing dust suppression system through water  spray
nozzles for Dump
      Hopper,  Transfer points in the conveyor  and  loading
chutes.
</p>
<p id="p_10">(b)  Bag filters to arrest dust in the silos.
</p>
<p id="p_11">(c)   Covering  all hoppers as well as conveyors  with  G.I.
Sheets.
</p>
<p id="p_12">(d)  Provisions of Green Belt around the unit.
</p>
<p id="p_13">(e)   17 mtrs. x 11 mtrs. Height wind cladding on all  three
sides of the dump hopper.
</p>

<p id="p_14">This  apart, the 7th respondent also stated that  they  have

taken  adequate  steps to provide a green  belt  around  the

Control  Room area as well as developing a green belt  cross

at dump hopper area.
</p>


<p id="p_15">      5.   In the counter affidavit of the 6th respondent it

is  submitted that the Environmental clearance in favour  of

the 6th respondent was obtained as back as on 3.5.1994;   No

Objection Certificate to set up the unit from the Tamil Nadu

Pollution Control Board was obtained on 24.5.1994;   consent

to   establish  the  plant  under  <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_2">section  21</a>  of  the  Air

(Prevention  and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control  of  Pollution)  Act</a>,  1981,   and

consent  under  <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_4">section  25</a>  of the  Water  (Prevention  and

control  of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, were obtained on 2.6.1998.
</p>
<p id="p_16">According to the 6th respondent, no hearing was required  to

be  given  in  public at that stage and in  fact  a  sum  of

Rs.1400  crores  has  been invested for the  power  project,

which is functioning from the end of 2002.
</p>


<p id="p_17">      6.   The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board  was asked

to inspect and submit a report to find out as to whether the

activities of the 6th and 7th respondents are detrimental to

the  public in general.  In its report dated 5.9.2007  while

it  is stated that the Unit was inspected on 3.9.2007,   the

following statements are made therein:

</pre><p id="p_62">      7.    The  learned  counsel for  the  writ  petitioner

requested  to  verify  as to whether  the  above  report  is

correct  or  not.   But,  in  the absence  of  any  contrary

material,  we  accept the report as submitted by  the  Tamil

Nadu Pollution Control Board.
</p>


<p id="p_63">     8.   Now the only question arises is whether any public

hearing  was given before grant of Environmental  Clearance,

in favour of the 6th respondent.
</p>


<p id="p_64">      9.    It is informed that the Public hearing was  made

mandatory  as back as on 27.1.1994, which was made  optional

on  3.5.1994.  It was again made mandatory on 10.4.1997.  In

the  present case, the Environmental Clearance was given  in

favour  of  M/s.Neyveli Lignite Corporation, on  23.12.1988,

which  was  subsequently transferred in favour  of  the  6th

respondent.  Thereafter,  Environmental Clearance in  favour

of the petitioner was given on 3.5.1994.  For more than 8 to

10 years no objection was raised by any individual including

the  petitioner till the company invested the  total  amount

and  started functioning since December, 2002.  In any case,

the  mandate  of  public  hearing was  made  optional  since

3.5.1994.
</p>


<p id="p_65">      10.  From the above said facts it is evident that when

the original Environmental Clearance was given in favour  of

NLC,  there  was  no  requirement  for  public  hearing  and

subsequently  when  it  was issued  in  favour  of  the  6th

respondent, it was made optional.   Again it was on the 10th

April,  1997, it was made mandatory.  In any case, now  more

than  ten  years  have  passed  since  the  Company  started

functioning and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board  also

after due verification, submitted a report in favour of  the

respondent and hence we are not inclined to decide the issue

as  raised in the amendment petition in W.P.M.P.No.18476  of

2003.
</p>


<p id="p_66">      11.   In  these  circumstances, no  further  order  is

required  to  be  passed  in the  present  case.   The  writ

petition  is  disposed of.  There will be  no  order  as  to

costs.  Connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
