:COMMON ORDER
********************
</pre><p id="p_1">N.PAUL VASANTHAKUMAR, J

	Since common issues are involved in all these Writ Petitions, they were
heard together and are disposed of by means of this Common Order by consent of
all the learned counsels.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. These Writ Petitions are filed by the Proprietors, M/s.Sulaimaniya Bone
Mill, M/s.Regina Package Industries and M/s.Palayathar Bone Mill respectively
challenging the order of the Appellate Authority, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control
Board, dated 08.09.2010 made in Appeal Nos.78, 77 and 79 of 2010, confirming the
order dated 28.04.2010 passed by the first respondent and for a consequential
direction to the first respondent to issue renewal of consent order for the year
2010 - 2011.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3. The short facts necessary for the disposal of the Writ Petitions are as
follows:-
</p><p id="p_4">	(i).The petitioners bone Crushing Unit are functioning from 01.11.1986,
01.05.1998 and 14.12.1957 respectively in their respective premises. The
petitioner in W.P.(MD).No.13273 of 2010 is producing crushed bone 25 tonne per
month from raw bones. Likewise, the petitioner in W.P.(MD).No.13274 of 2010 is
producing crushed bone 20 tonne per month, boiled hooked meal 10 tonne per
month, boiled horns meal 15 tonne per month and mutton tallow 5 tonne per month
from raw bones. Similarly, the petitioner in W.P.(MD).No.13275 of 2010 is
producing bone meal 12 tonne per month from raw crushed bones.
</p><p id="p_5">	(ii). The Pollution Control Board had issued consent order to the
petitioners unit under Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 and under Air (P&amp;CP) Act, 1981, by
its proceedings dated 23.03.1990, 24.09.1999 and 10.05.1991 respectively subject
to certain conditions and the said consent was renewed to the petitioners unit
in W.P.(MD).Nos.13273 and 13275 of 2010 up to 30.09.1998. Insofar as the
petitioner in W.P.(MD).No.13273 of 2010 is concerned, the consent was not
subsequently renewed. According to the petitioners, they have submitted renewal
applications by paying prescribed fee. However, the Pollution Control Board has
not chosen to pass any order either granting or rejecting the request of renewal
of consent and the said renewal applications are pending with the first
respondent - Pollution Control Board. The petitioners are operating the units
during the pendency of the applications seeking renewal of consent.
</p><p id="p_6">	(iii). According to the petitioners, due to some civil litigation with
other industries, various complaints regarding functioning of the petitioners
unit relates to pollution were made and some of residents formed an association
under the name and style of "Sornapuram Mettu Theru Nala Sangam" and started
agitating for ratifying their unauthorized constructions and also for providing
basic amenities like roads, pathway etc. The association also tried to interfere
with the operation of the petitioners unit and one of the parties in the Civil
Suit instituted a Public Interest Litigation in W.P.(MD).No.3982 of 2010 before
a Division Bench of this Court.
</p><p id="p_7">	(iv). In the said Writ Petition, on 25.03.2010 notice was ordered. During
the pendency of the said Writ Petition, the first respondent passed an order on
28.04.2010 under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_2">Section 31(A)</a> of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution),
Act, 1981, after issuing show cause notice on 22.02.2010. It is stated in the
said order that on 07.04.2010, the second respondent inspected the industrial
premises and at that time, the submission of renewal application was stated,
which was failed to be taken note of by the first respondent while passing the
orders of closure.
</p><p id="p_8">	(v). Challenging the said orders, the petitioners preferred
W.P.(MD).Nos.6726, 6725 and 6945 of 2010. A Division Bench of this Court, by
order dated 13.05.2010, disposed of the said Writ Petitions granting liberty to
the petitioners to approach the Appellate Authority and file appeal and work out
their remedies. The operation of the order dated 28.04.2010 passed by the first
respondent was ordered to be kept in abeyance for a period of four weeks from
13.05.2010 enabling the petitioners to file appeal.
</p><p id="p_9">	(vi). The third respondent herein filed Review Application Nos.44 and 43
of 2010 and prayed for reviewing the order dated 13.05.2010 made in
W.P.(MD).Nos.6726 and 6725 of 2010. The said Review Applications were also
dismissed by a Division Bench of this Court by order dated 09.06.2010.
Thereafter, the petitioners filed Appeal Nos.78, 77 and 79 of 2010 respectively
before the fourth respondent - Appellate Authority, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control
Board. The fourth respondent rejected the said appeals on 08.09.2010 and
confirmed the order of the first respondent dated 28.04.2010.
</p><p id="p_10">	4. The said individual orders dated 08.09.2010 passed by the fourth
respondent confirming the order of the first respondent dated 28.04.2010 are
challenged in these Writ Petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_11">	5. The contentions of the learned counsel for the petitioners are that the
petitioners having applied for renewal by remitting renewal fee, the first
respondent is not justified in ordering closure of the units without passing any
order on the renewal applications and pendency of renewal applications shall be
treated as a renewal of consent. The petitioners unit are functioning for the
past several years and by the closure order passed, the employees working in the
said units are put to serious prejudice.
</p>
<p id="p_12">	6. The learned counsel also submitted that on 06.05.2008, certain
documents were sought for by the first respondent to proceess the renewal of
consent application and the same were also furnished by the petitioners and
still the first respondent is keeping the renewal of consent application
pending.
</p>
<p id="p_13">	7. The learned Standing Counsel appearing for the Tamil Nadu Pollution
Control Board, on the other hand, submitted that the said consent was renewed to
the petitioners unit in W.P.(MD).Nos.13273 and 13275 of 2010 up to 30.09.1998.
Insofar as the petitioner in W.P.(MD).No.13274 of 2010 is concerned, the consent
was not renewed after 1999 and though the petitioners paid renewal fee, no
application in the prescribed format was submitted by the petitioners, and
therefore, on the basis of the inspection made, the units were issued with show
cause notices by the District Environmental Engineer, Tirunelveli on 03.02.2004,
09.07.2004, 24.07.2006, 27.01.2006 and 22.02.2010 to the petitioner in
W.P.(MD).No.13273 of 2010; 10.07.2004, 22.04.2009 and 22.02.2010 to the
petitioner in W.P.(MD).No.13274 of 2010; and 03.02.2004, 31.01.2005, 24.07.2006,
20.12.2007, 27.01.2009 and 22.02.2010 to the petitioner in W.P.(MD).No.13275 of
2010. In the said notices, violations made by the petitioners unit were pointed
out and the same were not yet to be rectified.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	8. The learned Standing Counsel also submitted that in spite of receipt of
the said show cause notices, the petitioners unit failed to take action to
control odour nuisance due to their running of their unit. On 07.04.2010, the
petitioners unit were inspected while they were in operation. The units are
surrounded by residential buildings. Frequent complaints were received against
the petitioners bone mill unit regarding odour nuisance. Therefore, the District
Environmental Engineer recommended the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to
issue directions under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_3">Section 31(A)</a> of the Air and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Pollution Act</a>, 1981, to
disconnect power supply, and thereafter, the closure order was issued and
disconnection of power supply under the provisions of <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_5">Section 31(A)</a> of the Air
and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Pollution Act</a>, 1981 was ordered and the power supply was also disconnected
by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board through its proceedings dated 28.04.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_15">	9. Pursuant to the directions issued by the Division Bench of this Court
in W.P.(MD).Nos.6726, 6725 and 6945 of 2010, dated 13.05.2010, the petitioners
preferred appeals before the Appellate Authority and the said appeals were also
dismissed on merits. Even after the order of the Appellate Authority, the
petitioners unit have not applied for renewal of consent. Since the consent was
not renewed, the petitioners have to apply for fresh consent and without any
application, the units have paid consent fee alone. There is no provision to
claim the deemed consent under the Air and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Pollution Act</a> and <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_8">Section 25(7)</a> of
the Water Act alone provides for deemed consent. Hence, the petitioners have to
comply with the request made by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board by
submitting various documents, and thereafter only, the Pollution Control Board
can process the same and pass appropriate orders.
</p><p id="p_16">	10. The third respondent, in these Writ Petitions, have also filed their
separate counter affidavits and supported the stand taken by the Pollution
Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_17">	11. The learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the learned counsel
for the respective respondents submitted that with effect from 16.06.2010, the
petitioners unit are not functioning due to closure order and disconnection of
power supply.
</p>
<p id="p_18">	12. We have considered the rival submissions made by the learned counsel
appearing for the petitioners and the learned counsel appearing for the
respective respondents and perused the documents.
</p>
<p id="p_19">	13. The point for consideration is whether the petitioners are justified
in praying to quash the order of closure passed by the first respondent dated
28.04.2010 and the order passed by the Appellate Authority, viz., the fourth
respondent dated 08.09.2010 and are justified in seeking a direction to the
first respondent to issue renewal of consent order for the year 2010 - 2011.
</p>	
<p id="p_20">	14. It is an admitted fact that the units are bound to get consent order
as required under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_9">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollutio)
Act, 1981. Admittedly, consent order was granted by the Tamil Nadu Pollution
Control Board to run their bone crushing unit and the said consent was renewed
to the petitioners unit in W.P.(MD).Nos.13273 and 13275 of 2010 up to
30.09.1998. Insofar as the petitioner in W.P.(MD).No.13274 of 2010 is concerned,
the consent was not at all renewed. Even though the petitioners have remitted
fee for renewal of consent, which was received by the first respondent, till
date, no order either granting consent or rejecting the same is passed by the
first respondent, who is the Competent Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_21">	15. It is the case of the first respondent that on 07.04.2010, the
petitioners unit were inspected and during inspection, it was found that odour
was felt in the surrounding area of the petitioners unit and there are
residential buildings surrounding the units. It is also the case of the first
respondent that certain particulars were called for to consider the renewal of
consent from the petitioners. According to the petitioners, some documents were
furnished by the petitioners and the same were disputed by respondents 1 and 2.
In the absence of a valid consent to run the units, the petitioners are not
entitiled to run the units, particularly, when there is air pollution in the
surrounding area of the petitioners unit, which were found during inspection
made on 07.04.2010. The closure order was passed after issuing show cause
notices to the petitioners. <a href="/doc/195059463/" id="a_10">Section 21(1)</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 states that no person shall, without the previous consent
of the State Board, establish or operate any industrial plant in an air
pollution control area. Deeming provision, as contended by the learned counsel
for the petitioners, will not apply to the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. It is not the case of the petitioners that there was no
air pollution due to functioning of their unit. Even if there is consent given,
the Pollution Control Board Authorities are empowered to inspect the units and
find out whether the conditions contained in the consent order are complied with
and is there any pollution. On inspection made on 07.04.2010, it was found that
there was odour in the surrounding emanetes from the petitioners unit in the
nearby residential area. Hence, on public interest, the impugned order dated
28.04.2010 was passed by the first respondent, which was confirmed by the order
of the fourth respondent dated 08.09.2010 by stating valid reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_22">	16. The payment of Demand Draft towards renewal fee is noted by the fourth
respondent. It is not the case of the first respondent that the fee paid for
renewal of consent has been returned to the petitioners. Hence, the first
respondent is not justified in contending that no application in the prescribed
format was submitted by the petitioners. If that is the requirement under the
Act, the first respondent ought to have returned the Demand Draft submitted by
the petitioners towards renewal fee and having retained the said amount, any
other details, which are required under the Act and Rules, can very well be
demanded by the first respondent from the petitioners. In the communication,
above referred to, the petitioners were directed to submit certain particulars
and according to the petitioners, some of them were furnished.
</p>
<p id="p_23">	17. Having regard to the said fact and the admitted postion that the units
are not operating from 16.06.2010, as no stay of closure order was passed
pending appeals or duing the pendency of these Writ Petitions, we are of the
considered view that interest of justice would be met by directing the first
respondent to demand whatever is required under the Act for considering the
request of the petitioners for renewal of consent and pass necessary orders
within a stipulated time.
</p><p id="p_24">	18. Accordingly, we are not inclined to set aside the impugned orders and
the Writ Petitions are disposed of in the following terms:-
The first respondent is directed to demand whatever is required under the Air
(Prevention and Control of Pollutio) Act, 1981, for considering the request of
the petitioners seeking renewal of consent within a period of two weeks from the
date of receipt of a copy of this order.
</p><p id="p_25">The petitioners are directed to submit those details to the first respondent
within a period of two weeks thereafter.
</p><p id="p_26">The first respondent is directed to consider all the documents, which the
petitioners are going to submit and pass necessary orders after hearing the
petitioners as well as the third respondent in these Writ Petitions before
deciding the said issue and the first respondent shall pass final orders on
merits and in accordance with law regarding renewal of consent within a period
of four weeks from the date of receipt of documents from the petitioners.
It is made clear that we are not inclined to grant permission to the petitioners
unit to operate pending consideration of renewal of consent taking note of the
fact that the units are not in operation right from 16.06.2010.	
No costs. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.
