    having been heard and reserved for

AAVCjudgmer1«t, o13'this'riay, the Court delivered the following:



Notiﬁcation dated 26.2.2004 issued by the Government of
Karnataka. In Annexure-'A' notification, it was speciﬁcally stated
that the nomination was under Section 4 of tlie"»Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for  

it was also stated that the nomination was "inH__l'pl.ace:_i.ofiSri;

Alexander, the present Chairman." ltivviasiifurther-I the if

terms and conditions of the appointment wou_l_di be notiﬁed

separately. Subsequently the Govefr-nment'*--issued iiAinne&gt;iure--'Bi'
Notiﬁcation dated 12.5.2004~..statin'g"thatiithep terimiiof appointment
of the first respondent as   shall be for a
period of three yearsyviith  the date on which
Annexure--'A' "'ipssiued'or until further orders.
In Annexure--'B--'.iipiiﬁoitiiicatiorryp  stated that the detailed
terms  issued separately. Thereafter
Government issuedv  order dated 14.7.2004 specifying
_.the devtaiiledi'*terms"ainid____conditions of appointment of the first
as*,iChapinnan of the Board. As per Annexure--C
Goveyninent the term of appointment of the first respondent

as Chairman iofithe Board shall be as speciﬁed in the notification

 .e1_.2.5i.i'.2(.)04 (i.e., Annexure~'B'). Thus cumulative effect of

Anne:}&lt;ures--'A', B' and 'C' was that the first respondent was

.inon1inated/ appointed as Chairman of the Karnataka State

 éontrol Board with effect from 26.2.2004 for a period of



three years or until further orders. It is also clear that the first
respondent's appointment as Chairman of the Board was against a
casual vacancy caused by the relinquishing of office bjﬁ.-""~~SI'i. J.

Alexendar, the then Chairman of the Board.

  It  fs'p.evciﬁcally pleaded by the respondents in the Writ

VViVa_ppointed as Chairman of the Board on 28.12.2002 for a period of

  26.2.2004 in the place of Sri. J. Alexander. These averments

were not controverted by the Writ petitioner. Hence,  it
has to be accepted that the first respondent was appointed as
Chairman of the Board in the casual vacancy caused ___by the

relinquishment of office by Sri. J. Alexander and that by"'*9iperation

of <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_4">Section 5(6)</a> of the Act, the first respondent was
