Koshy, Ag.C.J.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            Writ Petition No.3266 of 2009 is filed by All Kerala

Crusher    Owners    Association,    Ernakulam     District Committee

contending that the crusher unit of the fifth respondent should be

stopped and action should be taken against them under <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_1">section 26</a>

of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a> (for short 'the

Act').  The above petitioner has no authority to represent           the

inhabitants of the area and they are not affected by the alleged air

pollution. They cannot say that since they have established crusher

units spending large amount, no others can establish such units. It

is also alleged that their unit is started without any authority of law.

But, respondent produced orders passed under Single Window

Clearance Scheme and they have got Ext.R5 (i) licence. Ext.R5(b) is

the consent given by the Pollution Control Board. Exts.R5 (a) to (i)

show that they obtained various permits and licences from the

statutory authorities to start the crusher unit.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C) Nos.2645 &amp; 3266/2009        2</span>

</p><p id="p_5">              2. W.P.(C) No.2645 of 2009 is filed by a citizen who is

stated to be a resident of Puthuvypin in Elankunnapuzha panchayat

as a Public Interest Litigation. According to him, the licence was

obtained stipulating conditions and there is violation of the

provisions of the Act and conditions in the licence and the crusher

unit is situated in the open area. It is not stated in the writ petition

about the distance from the crusher unit and his residence.      If the

consent issued by the Pollution Control Board is against the

provisions of the Act, a statutory appeal is provided and those who

are aggrieved can file appeal before the statutory authorities. If any

of the conditions of consent order are violated, the aggrieved

parties can point out to the Senior Environmental Engineer of the

Pollution Control Board so that remedial measures can be taken.

The Pollution Control Board has got even power to stop operation of

the unit and cancel the licence if conditions in the order of the

Pollution Control Board are violated. It is stated that if licence is

refused or if licence is granted illegally, aggrieved parties can file

appeal. Apart from the appellate remedy, <a href="/doc/40836587/" id="a_3">section 30</a> of the Act

gives power to the State Board to interfere with the orders of the

District Board suo motu and suo motu power can be exercised if any

of the aggrieved parties bring to the attention of the State Board

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) Nos.2645 &amp; 3266/2009          3</span>

about the irregularities and it is a revisional power. If any of the

statutory conditions are violated, it is for the parties to approach the

statutory authorities to stop the operation and in the wake of valid

certificates produced, we are unable to interfere in the matter in a

petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. This judgment

is pronounced without prejudice to the right of the parties in

approaching the statutory authorities.

<p id="p_6">              Both writ petitions are disposed of.
