<p id="p_1">T.S.Thakur, C.J. (Oral)

              This writ petition assails the validity of an order dated 27.6.2008

passed by the Punjab Pollution Control Board, Patiala, issuing directions under

<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33-A</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 ( for

short ' the Act' ), and proceedings of even date based on a personal hearing held

on 23.6.2008, whereunder certain further directions regarding compliance of

the provisions of the Act aforementioned, have been issued by the Board. The

petitioner also prays for a mandamus directing the respondent-Board to permit

the petitioner to operate its industrial unit to its full capacity and to extend the

time for filling up of two katcha Lagoons and submission of the scheme for

rejuvenation of ground water by a further period of four months. In addition,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> CWP No. 13862 of 2008                                                            2</span>



the petitioner seeks extension of time to instal and commission the equipment's

(Boiler, Evaporator and Incinerator) by 12 months from the date of passing of

the order. It has also prayed for dispensing with the condition, under which the

petitioner has been asked to furnish a bank guarantee for a sum of Rs. 75 lacs

to   the   respondent-Board.    The   controversy   arises      in   the   following

circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_2">              The petitioner-company has established and is running a distillery

and a food division in the name &amp; style of Jagatjit Industries at G.T.Road,

Hamira, District Kapurthala (Punjab). It claims to be producing approximately

120 KL of alcohol per day in its distillery. The Food Division is similarly

producing a number of food items sold under different brand names. Since the

industrial process which the petitioner's unit undertake is prone to cause

pollution, the respondent Pollution Control Board appears to have taken note

and pointed out shortcomings in compliance with the statutory requirements,

and directed removal of the same. The measures taken by the petitioner were

not, however, to the satisfaction of the Board, who appears to have withdrawn

the consent given by it in terms of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_3">Sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_4">26</a> of the Act. Aggrieved,

the petitioner has appealed to the competent Appellate Authority. It is not in

dispute that said appeal is pending disposal even at present.

</p><p id="p_3">              In the meantime, the Pollution Control Board passed an order on

27.6.2008, in which, it referred to the various stages through which the

proceedings have progressed in the past and the orders issued by the Board

from time to time, calling upon to it to comply with the requirements of the

statute so as to bring the pollution levels of the effluents within permissible

limits. The Board has eventually taken the view that since the measures

adopted by the petitioner-industry were not satisfactory, it was required to take
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> CWP No. 13862 of 2008                                                              3</span>



further steps to ensure that the same are in place within a time frame. In the

meantime, the petitioner was directed to reduce its production capacity to half

of the permitted capacity. According to the respondent-Board, the petitioner

industry having been permitted to manufacture 70 K.L. of alcohol per day, it

could not take the output beyond 35 K.L. per day. The Board had also directed

the petitioner-industry to take necessary steps and to upgrade its existing

treatment system to achieve the prescribed levels within a period of two months

from the date of the order. The petitioner-industry was further directed to

submit a scheme for making adequate and environmentally sound arrangements

to rejuvenate the quality of ground water within two months. In the event of

the failure on the part of the petitioner-industry to comply with the directions

issued to it, the units were to be deemed to have been closed in terms of

<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_5">Section 33-A</a> of the Act.

<p id="p_4">              By a separate order passed on the same date and described as

"proceedings of personal hearing taken by the Chairman of the Board on

23.6.2008", the following directions were issued by the Board:-

              It was submitted by Mr. Aggarwal, learned Senior counsel

appearing for the petitioner that while the petitioner is ready to furnish a bank

guarantee of Rs.75 lacs, the encashment of the said bank guarantee should be

made subject to the previous permission of this Court. Mr. Sarin, learned

Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent-Board was not agreeable to any

such condition. He submitted that since the bank guarantee is required to be

furnished in terms of the impugned order and direction issued by the Board,

there is no need to insist on the previous permission of this Court for

encashment especially when the present writ petition is being finally disposed

of. He was, however, agreeable to a condition being incorporated in the

impugned orders and directions to the effect that if the bank guarantee is

encashed at any stage for non-compliance with the directions contained in the

two impugned orders of the Board, the respondents shall not make use of the

amount received by it for the purpose for which it has been provided for a

period of four weeks, during which time the petitioner shall have the

opportunity to seek     such    redress from the competent court, as may be

available to them. Mr. Sarin further submitted that since the petitioner has

during the pendency of this writ petition applied for grant of fresh consent, the

petitioner should be asked not only to withdraw the appeals filed by it against

the order of withdrawl of consent but also the applications seeking fresh

consent, both of which matters shall stand concluded by the present order

granting extension to the petitioner till the end of June, 2009. Mr. Aggarwal is

agreeable to that suggestion.

<p id="p_36">              In the circumstances and with the consent of learned counsel for

the parties, we direct that the time frame, as indicated herein above, for

installation and commissioning of the Effluent Treatment Plant and various

other measures referred to and reproduced therein, shall stand extended as

indicated in the body of this order. The orders passed and directions issued by

the respondent-Board shall to that extent stand modified. We further direct that

the amount of Rs. 75 lacs covered by the Bank guarantee to be furnished by the

petitioner in terms of the impugned orders and directions issued by the Board,

shall not be utilised by the respondent Board for a period of four weeks from

the date the encashment takes place to enable the petitioner to seek such redress

against the utilisation thereof as may be otherwise open to it in law. Needless to

say that petitioner shall withdraw the appeal pending before the Appellate

Authority as also the fresh applications for grant of consent, as agreed to by

Mr. Aggarwal. We also make it clear that in case of default on the part of the

petitioner to comply with any one of the conditions stipulated by the Board

within the extended/modified time frame fixed above, the unit shall be deemed

to have been closed in terms of <a href="/doc/81392085/" id="a_10">Section 33-A</a> of the Act. Conversely, in case

the Effluent Treatment Plant is installed and commissioned within the

stipulated time frame and it is found to be effective in bringing the discharge of

effluents to the standard prescribed by the Board, the petitioner shall be

deemed to have given its consent in terms of <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_11">Sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_12">26</a> of the Act. We

also make it clear that this order shall not prevent the respondent-Board from

taking any decision regarding enhancement in the production capacity of the

petitioner unit during the period ending 30.06.2009 if it is otherwise satisfied

that such an enhancement is factually justified and legally permissible.
