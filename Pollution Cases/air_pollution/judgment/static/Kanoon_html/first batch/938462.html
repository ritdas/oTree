ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 
 


 

<p id="p_1">1.		The
present appeal under <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_1">section 378</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 is directed against the judgment and order of acquittal dated
10.6.2008 passed by the learned Addl.   Judicial Magistrate First
Class, at Halol, Dist. Panchmahals, in Criminal Case no. 6049/2004
whereby the accused  have been acquitted of the charges under
<a href="/doc/195059463/" id="a_2">sections 21(1)(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_3">31A</a> and <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_4">37</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p> 

<p id="p_2">2.		Brief
facts of the prosecution case are that the appellant filed Criminal
complaint against the respondents in the court of the learned Addl.
Judicial Magistrate First Class, Halol, Dist. Panchmahals, for the
violation of <a href="/doc/195059463/" id="a_6">sections  21(1)(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_7">31A</a> and <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_8">37</a> of the Air (Prevention
and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_3">3.		With
a view to prove the case against the respondents -accused, the
appellant has led oral as well as  documentary evidence. After the
trial, after recording statement of the accused person under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_10">section
313</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code, and after hearing arguments on
behalf of the complainant and the defence, the learned Addl. Judicial
Magistrate First Class, Halol has acquitted the respondents-accused
of all the charges levelled against them by the judgment an order
dated  10.6.2008.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_4">4.		Being
aggrieved and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and order
passed by the learned  Judicial Magistrate,  the appellant has
preferred the present appeal.  
</p>
 
	 


	  

<p id="p_5">5.		Heard
	learned Advocate Mr. Sunil Mehta for the appellant at length.  He
	has contended that the appellant has proved the case against the
	respondents-accused beyond all reasonable doubt. It is also
	contended that the appellant has also proved documentary evidence to
	prove the appellant's  case. He has also vehemently argued that the
	learned trial Judge has not considered the oral as well as
	documentary evidence produced by the prosecution.
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_6">6.		At
the outset, it is required to be noted that the principles which
would govern and regular the hearing of appeal by this  Court against
an order of acquittal passed by the trial Court have been very
succinctly explained by the Apex Court in a catena of decisions. In
the case of <a href="/doc/533881/" id="a_11">M.S.Narayana Menon @ Mani vs. State of Kerala and Anr</a>.
reported in (2006) SCC 39, the Apex Court has narrated about the
powers of the High Court in appeal against the order of acquittal. In
para 54 of the decision, the Apex Court has observed as under: 
</p>
 


<p id="p_7">"54: In
any event the High Court entertained an appeal treating to be an
appeal against acquittal, it was in fact exercising the revisional
jurisdiction. Even while exercising an appellate power against a
judgment of acquittal, the High Court should have borne in mind the
well settled principles of law that where two views are possible, the
appellate court should not interfere with the finding of acquittal
recorded by the court below."
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_8">7.		Further,
in the case of <a href="/doc/761643/" id="a_12">Chandrappa vs.
State of Karnataka</a>, reported in (2007) 4 SCC 415 the Apex
Court laid down the following principles:
</p> 


<p id="p_9"> "42: From
the above decisions, in our considered view, the following general
principles regarding powers of the appellate court while dealing with
an appeal against an order of acquittal emerge:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_10">(1) An
appellate court has full power to review, re-appreciate and
reconsider the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_11">(2)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_13"> The Code</a> of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts no limitation, restriction or condition
on exercise of such power and an appellate court on the evidence
before it may reach its own conclusion, both on questions of act and
of law.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_12">(3) Various
expressions, such as "substantial and compelling reasons",
"good and sufficient grounds", "very strong
circumstances", "distorted conclusions", "glaring
mistakes", etc. are not intended to curtain extensive powers of
an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal. Sych phraseologies
are more in the nature of "flourishes of language" to
emphasis the reluctance of an appellate court to interfere with
acquittal than to curtain he power of the court to review the
evidence and to come to its own conclusion. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_13">(4) An
appellate court, however, must bear in mind that in case of
acquittal, there is double presumption in favour of the accused.
Firstly,the presumption of innocence is available to him under the
fundamental principles of criminal jurisprudence that every person
shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a
competent court of law. Secondly, the accused having secured his
acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is further reinforced,
reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial court.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_14">(5) If two
reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on
record, the appellate court should not disturb the finding of
acquittal recorded by the trial court."
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_15">8.		Thus,
it is a settled principle that while exercising appellate power, even
if two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the
evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb the
finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_16">9.		Even
in a recent decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/585040/" id="a_14">State
of Goa, vs. Sanjay Thakran and Anr</a>. reported in (2007)3 SCC 75,
the Court has reiterated the powers of the High Court in such cases.
In para 16 of the said decision the Court has observed as under:
</p> 


<p id="p_17">  "16.
</p><p id="p_18">From the aforesaid decisions, it is apparent that while exercising
the powers in appeal against the order of acquittal the Court of
appeal would not ordinarily interfere with the order of acquittal
unless the approach of the lower Court is vitiated by some manifest
illegality and the conclusion arrived at would not be arrived at by
any reasonable person and, therefore, the decision is to be
characterised as perverse. Merely because two views are possible, the
Court of appeal would not take the view which would upset the
judgment delivered by the Court below. However, the appellate court
has a power to review the evidence if it is of the view that the
conclusion arrived at by the Court below is perverse and the Court
has committed a manifest error of law and ignored the material
evidence on record. A duty is cast upon the appellate court, in such
circumstances, to re-appreciate the evidence to arrive to a just
decision on the basis of material placed on record to find out
whether any of the accused is connected with the commission of the
crime he is charged with."
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_19">10.		Similar
principle has been laid down by the Apex Court in the cases of
<a href="/doc/550589/" id="a_15">State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Ram Veer Singh and Ors</a>., reported in 2007
AIR SCW 5553 and in Girja Prasad (Dead) by <a href="/doc/614758/" id="a_16">LRS vs. State of MP</a>,
reported in 2007 AIR SC 5589. Thus, the powers which this
Court may exercise against an order of acquittal are well settled.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_20">11.		It
is also a settled legal position that in acquittal appeal, the
appellate court is not required to re-write the judgment or to give
fresh reasonings, when the reasons assigned by the Court below are
found to be just and proper. Such principle is laid down by the Apex
Court in the case of <a href="/doc/131360/" id="a_17">State of
Karnataka vs. Hemareddy</a>, reported in AIR 1981 SC 1417,
wherein, it is held as under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_21">    "...This
Court has observed in Girija Nandini Devi vs. Bigendra Nandini
Chaudhary (1967) SCR 93; (AIR 1967 SC 1124) that it is not the duty
of the appellate court when it agrees with a view of the trial court
on the evidence to repeat the narration of the evidence or to
reiterate the reasons given by the trial court expression of general
agreement with the reasons given by the Court the decision of which
is under appeal, will ordinarily suffice."
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_22">12.		Thus,
in case the appellate court agrees with the reasons and the opinion
given by the lower court, then the discussion of evidence is not
necessary.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_23">13.		I
have gone through the judgment and order passed by the trial court. I
have also perused the oral as well as documentary evidence led before
the trial court and also considered the submissions made by the
learned Advocate for the appellant-original complainant. The trial
court while considering the oral as well as documentary evidence has
clearly observed that the appellant has  miserably failed to prove
its case beyond reasonable doubt against the respondents.   The
appellant   original complainant has failed to prove the ownership
of the disputed place and in view of the non-production of the
document regarding ownership of that place, the case of the appellant
falls to the ground.  Even in the present appeal, nothing is produced
or pointed out to rebut the conclusion of the trial court. Thus, from
the evidence itself, it is established that the appellant has not
proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_24">14.		Learned
Advocate for the appellant  is not in a position to show any evidence
to take a contrary view of the matter or that the approach of the
trial court is vitiated by some manifest illegality or that the
decision is perverse or that the trial court has ignored the material
evidence on record.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_25">15.		In
the above view of the matter, I am of the considered view that the
trial court was completely justified in acquitting the respondents of
the charges levelled against them.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_26">16.		I
find that the findings recorded by the trial court are absolutely
just and proper and in recording the said findings, no illegality or
infirmity has been committed by it.
</p> 

<p id="p_27">17.		I
am, therefore, in complete agreement with the findings, ultimate
conclusion and the resultant order of acquittal recorded by the court
below and hence find no reason to interfere with the same. Hence, the
appeal preferred by the appellant is  hereby dismissed. Record and
Proceedings be sent back to the trial court forthwith. Bail bonds, if
any, stand cancelled.
