HEADNOTE:



JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">			 O R D E R
     Leave granted.
</p><p id="p_2">     This appeal  is directed against the judgment and order
of a  Division Bench  of the  High Court  of  Judicature  at
Madras in  Wrist Petition No. 17333 of 1995 dated 17th July,
1997.
</p><p id="p_3">     After hearing  learned  counsel  for  the	parties	 and
examining the record we are satisfied that the matter before
the High  Court was  one of  public interest and required an
in-depth examination by the court. The Division Bench of the
High Court,  it appears to us, failed to appreciate the true
significance of	 the matter regarding the need to arrest the
unabated pollution,  which had	become a  health hazard	 and
environmental enemy  because of	 discharge of  objectionable
effluents  from	  the  distillery  into	 Bhavani  River	 and
adjoining areas.  The High Court feel in error to dispose of
the writ  petition merely  on the  consent of the Tamil Nadu
Pollution Control  Board. Matters  like this,  which involve
greater public	interest  should  not  normally	 be  decided
merely on  consent of  the Pollution  Control Board.  We are
somewhat unhappy  about the  manner in	which the  Pollution
Control Board  gave  its  consent  unmindful  of  the  grave
consequences, which  have been amply demonstrated before us.
The order of the High Court, therefore, cannot be sustained.
We, accordingly,  allow this  appeal and set aside the order
of the High Court and remand the writ petition to it for its
fresh disposal in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_4">     During the	 pendency of  the proceedings in this court,
certain affidavits  and undertakings were filed on behalf of
the industry  respondent No. 6, and on 29th January, 1998 we
gave certain  directions including  the	 direction  for	 the
closure of  the operation  of the Industry (respondent No.6)
on or  before  2nd  February,  1998  because  of  continuing
pollution from	its distillery	and sugar  division. We also
directed inspection of the industry and the site adjacent to
it by  NEERI, who  was also asked to submit a report to this
Court  whether	the  pollution	control	 devices  have	been
installed by  the Industry and proper steps taken to control
pollution in  accordance with  the provisions  of the  Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter
Act)  or  not.	NEERI  was  also  directed  to	inspect	 the
surrounding areas  with a  view to assess damage, caused due
to discharge of effluent by the Industry and to indicate the
cost of restitution.
</p><p id="p_5">     Pursuant  to  the	directions  issued  by	us  on	29th
January, 1998,	NEERI has  submitted two  reports. The first
inspection report  was submitted on 9th March, those reports
and since  we are  remanding the  writ perused those reports
and since  we are  remanding the  writ petition	 to the High
Court for  its disposal,  it appears  appropriate to  us, to
request the  High Court	 to consider  those reports  and the
suggestions made  therein while	 passing orders	 in the Writ
Petition from time to time.
</p><p id="p_6">     Mr. Venugopal, learned Senior counsel appearing for the
Industry, submits  that remedial  steps	 have  already	been
taken as  suggested by	this Court  as well  as by NEERI and
that  Pollution	 to  prevent  pollution	 of  water  and	 the
Industry may, therefore, be permitted to operate.
</p><p id="p_7">     Mr. Harish	 Salve, learned	 amicus curiae	on the other
hand submits that all steps required to check pollution have
not been taken and in support of his submission, relies upon
the two reports submitted by NEERI to this Court.
</p><p id="p_8">     The High Court may, therefore:
</p><p id="p_9">     1.	   Consider in consultation with
     NEERI, whether  the Industry may be
     permitted to  have a  test	 run  or
     become operational and, if so, with
     what  further   safeguards	  and/or
     remedial measures	to be taken. For
     this  purpose  NEERI  shall  appear
     before the High Court of Madras and
     inform  the   Court  regarding  the
     viability of  the Industry starting
     either  the   test	  run	or   its
     operation.	 The   High  Court  may,
     thereafter, pass appropriate orders
     regarding the lifting of the ban on
     operations	 which	was  imposed  by
     this Court	 on operations which was
     imposed by this Court on 26.1.1998.
</p><p id="p_10">     2.	  The High Court may also direct
     supervision by  any of the agencies
     including NEERI  or  the  Pollution
     Control Board,  with a  view to see
     that the  Industry does  not  cause
     any type  of pollution,  in case it
     is permitted to become operational.
</p><p id="p_11">     3.	  The  High   Court  shall  also
     examine the question of restitution
     of the  areas damaged on account to
     the pollution  already caused.  The
     costs  of	 the  pollution	 already
     caused.   The    costs    of    the
     restitution shall	be borne by M/s.
</p><p id="p_12">     was requested to submit its report.
</p><p id="p_13">     4.	   The	High Court shall monitor
     the  case	till  such  time  as  is
     considered necessary by it .
</p><p id="p_14">     The High  Court may  appoint amicus curiae to assist it
for disposal  of the  case and burden the Industry with such
costs as it may deem  fit.
</p><p id="p_15">     The parties, through their learned counsel are directed
to appear  before the  High Court on 6th August, 1998. NEERI
shall also  be requested  to appear before the High Court on
the same  date to  give its  opinion  on  technical  matters
regarding the operational viability of the Industry.
</p><p id="p_16">     In so  for as  the costs  in this	Court are concerned,
learned	 amicus	  curiae,  Mr.	 Harish	 Salve	assisted  by
Mr.S.Muralidhar	 Services   Committee.	We   appreciate	 the
gesture show  by the  learned counsel. We also wish to place
on record  our appreciation  for the  assistance rendered by
Mr.Harish Salve, Senior Advocate and Mr.S.Muralidhar in this
Court.
</p><p id="p_17">     The Industry  M/s.Sakthi Sugars  Ltd., Tamil Nadu shall
pay a  sum of  Rs. 20,000/-  by way of costs, which shall be
deposited in the account of the Supreme Court Legal Services
Committee within one week.
</p><p id="p_18">     The Registry  shall transmit the complete record of the
case to	 the High Court without any delay. The record may be
sent by	 courier for  which the	 expenses shall	 be borne by
respondent No. 6.
