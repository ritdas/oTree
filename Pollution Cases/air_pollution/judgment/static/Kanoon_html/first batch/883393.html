<p id="p_1">      Three Assistant Environmental Engineers and a Senior Grade

Assistant of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board are the

petitioners in this writ petition. They challenge Ext.P15 order

dated 30/10/2010 issued by the 1st respondent, Government of

Kerala, placing them under suspension pending detailed enquiry

against them.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.   The contention raised by the learned Senior Counsel

for the petitioners is that the conditions of service of the

petitioners herein are regulated by the Kerala State Pollution

Control Board Disciplinary Rules framed by the Kerala State

Pollution Control Board in exercise of its powers under the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. According to him,

under Rule 7, Chairman of the Board or any authority subordinate

to him or any authority empowered by him, alone is competent to

place an employee of the Board under suspension. On this basis,

it is argued that Ext.P15 is an order without jurisdiction, and on

that ground, this order is sought to be quashed.

WPC No. 33922/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 :2 :</span>



</p><p id="p_3">      3.     In order to appreciate the contentions raised and to

decide whether the impugned order calls for interference, the facts

which led to the issuance of Ext.P15, as disclosed from the counter

affidavit filed on behalf of the 1st respondent, needs to be looked

into.  It is stated that M/s.Canon Granites Private Limited, the

Director of which has got himself impleaded in this writ petition as

additional respondent No.4, is functioning within Trichur District

from the year 1997. The industrial unit is engaged in crushing of

stone boulders obtained from quarries into metal, for which it had

installed two new crushing units. The industry sought NOC from

the Board through the Trichur District Office. The application was

rejected and in WP(C) No.1759/05 filed by the aforesaid company,

this Court issued order dated 8/4/05 directing that a trial run be

conducted in the premises of the industry for a period of 8 hours to

check the pollution levels. It is stated that, thereupon the then

Environmental Engineer of Trichur District, Sri.A.K.Surendran was

contacted and though this court's order was also produced, no

action was taken. Again when contacted, Sri.Surendran informed

the additional 4th respondent that they would conduct the test run

and issue NOC if his demands for illegal gratification were met, or

WPC No. 33922/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  :3 :</span>



else, the NOC would not be granted and an adverse report will be

made.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.    It is stated that, on 18/5/2005, he demanded an illegal

gratification of Rs.15 lakhs and when Sri.Surendran persisted in his

demand, the additional 4th respondent submitted a complaint to

the CBI. After verifying the allegation, CBI referred the matter to

the Vigilance and Anti Corruption Bureau of the State and

accordingly, the additional 4th respondent met the DYSP, Vigilance

and Anti Corruption Bureau, Trichur.          It is stated that a

conversation between the complainant and the Environmental

Engineer, in which the complainant was directed to deliver the

money in a packet to two persons named by the Engineer at a

Hotel on 27/5/2005 was also recorded. However, the complainant

expressed his inability to comply with the demand, and therefore,

on 28/5/2005, Sri.Surendran, the Environmental Engineer, along

with other staff members went to the office of M/s.Canon Granites

and informed that they were going to commence the trial run and

that if the amount demanded was not handed over by 12 noon, the

trial run would be stopped and an adverse report would be made.

This again was reported to the Vigilance and Anti Corruption

WPC No. 33922/10

Bureau, which registered VC No.7/05 and trap amount of Rs.2

lakhs was produced by the complainant.         It is stated that, as

directed by the Environmental Engineer, the trap party went over

to Sreebhavan Hotel. The developments that were taking place at

the hotel were being monitored by the Environmental Engineer

through telephone and as instructed by him, amount was handed

over to one Rajendran, who was waiting at the hotel counter.

Immediately, Sri.Rajendran and one Sri.Gopalakrishnan, who also

waiting along with him, were apprehended by the Vigilance party.

</p><p id="p_5">      5.    It is stated that, immediately on coming to know of the

trap laid by the Vigilance authorities, on the night of 28/5/05 itself,

the Environmental Engineer made immediate arrangements to see

that the staff of the Board attended the office on 29/5/2005, a

Sunday and created documents to show that an adverse report

had been made against M/s.Canon Granites on 28/5/2005 itself

and that the documents were duly despatched on the same day

itself to the then Chairman, Member Secretary and also to the then

standing counsel for the Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_6">      6.    In so far as the petitioners herein are concerned, the

allegation is that, as instructed by the Environmental Engineer,

WPC No. 33922/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                :5 :</span>



they were at the office on 29.5.2005 along with Senior Accounts

Assistant and a Casual Driver and that the 4th petitioner was also

called over since he was having one of the keys of the office. It is

stated that, on that day, file notings and reports were created

dating the documents with 28/5/2005 and an antedated letter was

also created and addressed to the standing counsel of the Board

with copy to the Member Secretary of the Pollution Control Board.

It is stated that these records were signed by the Environmental

Engineer and entries were also made in the despatch register to

show that these documents were despatched on 28/5/2005 itself.

It is stated that the second petitioner read the note sheets and

drafted the adverse reports, while the first petitioner and the 3rd

petitioner verified and corrected the same. The letter was shown

despatched on 28.5.2005 by making interpolations in the Despatch

Register. It is alleged that these documents were created only to

enable Sri.Surendran to got himself absolved of the trap case.

</p><p id="p_7">      7.   Subsequently, the additional 4th respondent moved this

court by filing WP(C) No.19759/05 and by order dated 24/4/2006,

the investigation into the case was directed to be entrusted to the

CBI. Thereupon, the CBI conducted enquiries, questioned various

WPC No. 33922/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 :6 :</span>



people, including the petitioners herein and final report was

submitted before the Court of Special Judge for CBI cases at

Ernakulam on 29/9/09. Later, the additional 4th respondent and one

Sri.Muraleedharan filed WP(C) Nos.36185/07 and 36205/07

complaining that inspite of the registration of CBI case and another

case before the Vigilance Court, no departmental action was

initiated against the Environmental Engineer Sri.A.K.Surendran.

According to them, instead of initiating departmental action

against him, Sri.Surendran was rewarded by promotion to the post

of Senior Environmental Engineer.         By a common judgment

rendered on 9th of October, 2009, this Court disposed of the writ

petitions with various directions to the Government of Kerala

including to consider as to whether Sri.A.K.Surendran should be

placed under suspension, whether it is necessary to initiate

disciplinary action and whether the promotion granted to him is

liable to be cancelled.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      8.   In this context, reference should be made to Exts.R1(b),

</p><p id="p_9">(c), (d) and (e), which are allegedly the statements of the

petitioners recorded by the investigating officers of the CBI. Ext.R1

</p><p id="p_10">(b) is the statement of the first petitioner. This document shows

WPC No. 33922/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 :7 :</span>



that the first petitioner has stated that, on the night of 28/5/2005,

at about 9 p.m. Environmental Engineer, Sri.A.K.Surendran

telephoned her in her land line and told her that the additional 4th

respondent had set a trap and that she should go to the office

immediately in the night itself and make out a report against

M/s.Canon Granites and that she told him that it will be done on

the next day.     It is stated that, thereupon the first petitioner

telephoned petitioners 2 and 3 and that in the next morning, she

asked the 4th petitioner to open the office. According to her, all of

them attended the office on 29/5/2005 and the second petitioner

drafted the note sheets and letter to standing counsel with copy to

the Member Secretary dating all the documents with 28/5/2005. It

is also stated that the first petitioner and the 3rd petitioner made

corrections and that one JiJi typed the draft, which was further

corrected by petitioners 1 and 3. It is also stated that Jiji made out

the final fair letter    and that    in the Despatch Register, the

documents were shown to have been despatched on 28/5/2005. It

is also stated that the first petitioner put the file containing the

note sheets, fair letter, drafts etc in a plastic cover and send the

same through one Dain C.Joseph to Sri.Surendran to put his initials

WPC No. 33922/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  :8 :</span>



at the appropriate places to make it appear as if the letters were

made, signed and despatched on 28/5/2005 during working hours.

To a specific question whether she was aware that she was

creating false evidence, her response was that she has done it to

avoid any harm to Sri.Surendran.              Exts.R1(c), (d) and (e)

statements allegedly given by the petitioners 2, 3 and 4

corroborates the statement of the first petitioner.

</p><p id="p_11">     9.     It is subsequent to all this that in pursuance to the

directions of this Court, the Government issued Ext.P15 order on

30/10/2010 placing the petitioners under suspension.                The

contents of Ext.P15 throws light not only to the culpability of the

then Chairman of Board, but also to the circumstances which

compelled the Government to intervene in the matter. Therefore, I

think it is profitable to extract Ext.P15 in its entirety and this order

reads as under:-

    in the CBI investigation report. Sri.Surendran who was
    placed under suspension on 13/10/2009 upon initiating
    disciplinary action on grave charges was reinstated in
    service on 15/5/2010 without referring to or consulting
    Government. It is observed that the Chairman himself
    conducted a personal hearing of the accused officer
    Sri.Surendran    and  has   dictated   the   proceedings
    No.PCB/E4/3800/2009 dt 15.5.2010.          Based on the
    defense statement given by the accused officer and
    corroborating statements purportedly given by other
    officers in the Board including the Chairman himself,
    the Chairman has held that the two allegations
    regarding false Travelling Allowance claims are not
    sustainable and that there is no evidence to prove the
    third allegation regarding tampering of records by the
    officer in collusion with other 4 employees, thereby
    virtually exonerating the accused officer of all charges.
    CBI had found material and oral evidence to prove the
    tampering of records to protect the accused officer
    Sri.Surendran    with   the   knowledge      and    active
    involvement of the then Member Secretary of the Board
    and the Government had accepted there findings and
    awarded the punishment of Censure to the present

    Chairman who was the then Member Secretary vide
    G.O.(Rt) No.22/2010 dated 24.3.2010.        Under these
    circumstances the action of Chairman to virtually
    exonerate the accused officer of the charges smacks of
    his continuing attempt to protect the accused officer
    inspite of the grave corruption charges brought against
    him, which is not under trial in a Court of Law.
    Chairman has also sought vide para 10 of the said
    proceedings dated 15.5.2010 to virtually exonerate the
    4 subordinate employees working of the Board from the
    grave charge of manipulation of office records for which
    disciplinary action was ordered by the Government.
    Thus the Chairman, Kerala State Pollution Control Board
    has abused the authority of the Office of the Chairman,
    by wilfully delaying the disciplinary actions against the
    5 employees as directed by the Government and by
    issuing the proceedings read as 6th paper above,
    virtually exonerating the accused officers of all charges
    by disregarding the findings of the CBI investigation
    report which was approved by Government.          He has
    also not taken any positive action on the direction of
    the Government to review the promotion given by the
    Board to the accused officer Sri.Surendran while he was
    facing grave charges of corruption.
</p>
<p id="p_15">           In the circumstances stated above, the order
    issued by the Chairman, Kerala State Pollution Control
    Board vide proceedings read as 6th paper above is
    quashed. Sri.Surendran, Senior Environmental Engineer,
    Kerala State Pollution Control Board is suspended from
    the service of the Board under Rule 10 of the KCS
    (CC&amp;A) Rule with immediate effect pending detailed
    enquiry into all allegations against him.     He will be
    eligible for subsistence allowance as per rules during
    the period of suspension.

<p id="p_16">           As the explanation provided by the 4 accused
    employees of the Board mentioned below to the Memo
    of charges issued to them are not acceptable,

      Assistant, Kerala State Pollution Control Board are also
      suspended from the service of the Board under Rule 10
      of the KCS (CC&amp;A) Rules, pending detailed enquiry.
      They are eligible for subsistence allowance as per rules
      during the period of suspension.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      10. It is true that going by the provisions contained in

Ext.P12, the Kerala State Pollution Control Board Disciplinary

Rules, the power to place an employee of the Board under

suspension is conferred on the Chairman of the Board or any

authority subordinate to him or any authority empowered by him

in that behalf. However, in view of the facts of this case as noticed

from the counter affidavit, which have not been contradicted by

any reply, the question to be considered is whether this is a fit

case for this Court to invoke its extraordinary jurisdiction under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, which admittedly is a

discretionary remedy.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      11. First of all, this is a case where the Environmental

Engineer allegedly demanded illegal gratification and was caught

in a trap case.    Prima facie material including the statements

allegedly made by the petitioners themselves to the investigating

officers show that on the directions of the Environmental Engineer,

petitioners have created false documents to save him from

WPC No. 33922/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                :13 :</span>



criminal prosecution. Materials further prima facie show that even

the person who was holding the office of Member Secretary of the

Pollution Control Board at the relevant point of time himself had a

role to play in the whole incident and that by the time this Court

disposed of WP(C) No.36185/2007 and 36205/2007 in October,

2009, he had become the Chairman of the Board itself. Ext.P15

order and the pleadings in the writ petition also show that not only

that the Chairman had exonerated Sri.Surendran and the

petitioners of the allegations against them, but the Chairman had

rewarded Sri.Surendran with a promotion. Thus, the Board itself

had failed to act in accordance with law to ensure purity in public

service and to weed out corruption from its service        and thus

abdicated its statutory duties. It was in such circumstances, the

Government had to step in and interfere in the matter by issuing

the impugned order.     The question is, whether inspite of such

factual background, this Court should interfere with such an order,

exercising its powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_19">      12. While dealing with this issue, I must also state that even

if the allegations in Ext.P15 are to be ignored for a moment,

Exts.R1(b), (c), (d) and (e), the statements allegedly made by the

WPC No. 33922/10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                 :14 :</span>



petitioners to the investigating officers of CBI, whatever be the

worth of it in a Criminal Court, prima facie indicate that the

petitioners themselves have admitted of having been parties to

the creation of false documents, with the only intention of saving

an accused from criminal proceedings. Therefore, if unrebutted,

the allegations disclosed in these documents establish the

existence of prima facie material, which render the petitioners

liable for disciplinary action. In such circumstances, acting upon

such materials, if disciplinary proceedings are contemplated and

the delinquents involved are placed under suspension, such action

of a disciplinary authority cannot be faulted. If so, the only issue is

whether inspite of the existence of prima facie case against the

petitioners, the impugned order warrants interference for the only

reason that it is issued by the Government.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      13. Now coming to the question whether this Court should

interfere with the impugned order is concerned, I am of the view

that, in the facts of this case, this Court shall not interfere with

Ext.P15 order. First of all, the Government have ordered

suspension of the petitioners only with the intention of ensuring

purity in the public office held by them, which primarily, is the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                 :15 :</span>



responsibility of the State. Secondly, Government was compelled

to interfere in the matter on account of the deliberate failure of the

authorities of the Board, whose culpability in the matter is evident

from the counter affidavit and Ext.P15 itself. Therefore, even if it

is assumed that it was the Chairman of the Board which ought to

have issued the order and that the Government should not have, in

the peculiar facts of this case, I am not persuaded to think that an

order issued by the Government should be interfered with for the

only reason that the Government did not have competence. If any

such order is passed, the result will be that delinquents will remain

in a public office and this Court will be enabling them to continue

their misdeeds.

<p id="p_21">      14. The manner in which the discretionary power under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article 226</a> of the Constitution should be exercised has been

indicated by this Court in Ext.R1(f), the judgment rendered in WA

No.1436/10 and connected cases, in paras 19 to 21, which are

extracted below for reference:-

     State in dealing with Jeyaprasad and Surendran in
     accordance with law, and in fact that at every stage this
     Court had to intervene to compel the State to act in
     accordance with law are factors which distinguish
     Jeyaprasad for a separate treatment. Apart from that
     the manner in which Jeyaprasad dealt with Surendran in
     spite of the serious allegations against him is also a
     strong factor that should weigh with the Court in
     deciding whether the discretion should be exercised in
     his favour. We desist from explaining those factors for
     the reason that any observation in that regard is likely to
     have an adverse effect on the investigation of the crime
     to be registered against Jeyaprasad. Exercising the
     discretion under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> in a case with such factual
     background in our view is likely to promote a
     misconception      that  the   judicial   branch    of   the
     Constitution is not different from the other branches. No
     misconception could do more lasting injury to this Court
     and to the system of law. It is immaterial whether justice
     is done or not to Jeyaprasad.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">     20.   In the background of the facts narrated above the
     question arises whether this Court should really exercise
     the extraordinary jurisdiction vested in it by the
     Constitution under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article 226</a> to issue writs or orders in
     the nature of mandamus or certiorari. It is well settled
     that both the writs are discretionary in nature but not
     writs of right. The extraordinary jurisdiction is created for
     the protection of the fundamental rights of the subjects
     and to prevent the abuse of the State's power. The
     jurisdiction is to be exercised either for the enforcement
     of a legal right of the subject or the enforcement of the
     legal obligations of the State. Courts have recognised a
     number of exceptional circumstances which justify the
     refusal to exercise the jurisdiction even in those cases
     where there is a clearly established legal right or
     obligation.</blockquote><p id="p_22">

     jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a> in favour of a person whose

       question if the allegations made against him are
       investigated and proved before a competent criminal
       court, would be not a sound exercise of the discretion

       of India.

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      12. However, our conclusion on the above issue does not
      conclude the dispute, if we accept the contention of the appellant
      on point No. 2. As we have already noted, according to the
      quashing of Ext.P5 and Ext.P7 would result in restoration of the
      orders of the Educational Authorities declining approval to his
      appointment which is per se illegal for other reasons and therefore
      we should restrain ourselves from exercising power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_10">Art.226</a>
      of the Constitution of India. Counsel made reference to various
      authorities in support of the above proposition canvassed by him.
      He has referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court reported in
      <a href="/doc/1125589/" id="a_11">Venkateswara Rao v. Government of Andhra Pradesh</a> (AIR 1966
      SC 828), wherein it has been observed as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       "If the High Court had quashed the said order, it would have
      restored an illegal order - it would have given the Health Centre to
      a village contrary to the valid resolutions passed by the Panchayat
      Samithi. The High Court, therefore, in our view, rightly refused to
      exercise its extraordinary discretionary power in the
      circumstances",

       This was followed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case
      reported in <a href="/doc/1999006/" id="a_12">M.Padmanabha Iyyengar v. Government of A.P.
      (AIR1990 A.P</a>.357) and held as follows:</blockquote><p id="p_25">

      the establishment of an irregularity or illegality. The court must
      further be satisfied that such interference is called for to meet, or
      to further, the orders of justice. If by interfering in the matter the
      interests of justice are going to suffer, this Court will withhold its

     circumstances, we do not think that this court should interfere and
     quash the Inquiry under S.5A."
</p>
<p id="p_27">     Still later in the case of <a href="/doc/743502/" id="a_16">Jagan Singh v. State Transport Appellate
     Tribunal (AlR</a> 1980 Raj. 1, it has been held as follows:

     "As we have already pointed out above, the effect of setting aside
     the impugned order passed by the Tribunal by a writ of certiorari
     would be restoring an invalid and illegal order passed by the
     Regional Transport Authority. Reference may also be made to
     <a href="/doc/1125589/" id="a_17">G.Venkateswara Rao v. Government of Andhra Pradesh</a> (AIR
     1966 SC 828)."
</p>
<p id="p_28">     Making reference to R. v. Garland ((1970) 5 QB 269), it was
     contended that even in issuing writs of mandamus, the same
     principle is followed and that if the effect of issuing mandamus is
     going to be highly prejudicial, as where it would enable trustees to
     evade the discharge of their duties, a court of equity will not issue
     the writ. These judgments were followed by a Division Bench of
     this Court in the case reported in <a href="/doc/1279793/" id="a_18">Koya v. State of Kerala</a> (1992 (2)
     KLT 194), where it has been held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_29">     "It is now well settled that if an order of an authority is illegal or
     without jurisdiction, it need not be quashed by the High Court
     under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_19">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution of India if such action would
     result in restoration or revival of another order, which is also bad."

     On this reasoning, this Court concluded in the following terms:

     "Following the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in
     <a href="/doc/1125589/" id="a_20">Venkateswara Rao v. Government of Andhra Pradesh</a> (AIR 1966
     SC 828) for exercise of discretion, we hold that this is not a fit
     case for quashing Ext.P5 order of the Government even if it was
     without jurisdiction for, such quashing would restore Ext.P4 order
     of the Wakf Board which is bad for other reasons. This is
     therefore, not a fit case for exercising discretion to quash Ext.P5."

     Counsel also made reference to the judgment in Mohammad
     Swallieh and Ors. v. Third Addl. District Judge, Meerut &amp; Anr.
     ((1988)1 SCC 40). Paragraph 7 thereof is extracted below for
     reference:
</p>
<p id="p_30">     "It was contended before the High Court that no appeal lay from
     the decision of the Prescribed Authority to the District Judge. The
     High Court accepted this contention. The High Court finally held
     that though the appeal laid (sic no appeal lay) before the District
     Judge, the order of the Prescribed Authority was invalid and was
     rightly set aside by the District Judge. On that ground the High
     Court declined to interfere with the order of the learned District

     Judge. It is true that there has been some technical breach
     because if there is no appeal maintainable before the learned
     District Judge. in the appeal before the learned District Judge, the
     same could not be set aside. But the High Court was exercising its
     jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_21">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. The High Court
     had come to the conclusion that the order of the Prescribed
     Authority was invalid and improper. The High Court itself could
     have set it aside. Therefore in the facts and circumstances of the
     case justice has been done though, as mentioned hereinbefore,
     technically the appellant had a point that the order of the District
     Judge was illegal and improper. If we reiterate the order of the
     High Court as it is setting aside the order of the Prescribed
     Authority in exercise of the jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_22">Art.226</a> of the
     Constitution then no exception can be taken. As mentioned
     hereinbefore, justice has been done and as the improper order of
     the Prescribed Authority has been set aside, no objection can be
     taken."
</p>
<p id="p_31">     We were also referred to the Supreme Court judgment in the case
     reported in <a href="/doc/623494/" id="a_23">Roshan Deen v. Preeti Lal</a> (2002 (1) KLT (SC) (SN)
     43 = AIR 2002 SC 33), where it has been held as follows:

     " Time and again this Court has reminded that the power
     conferred on the High Court under Arts.226 and 227 of the
     Constitution is to advance justice and not to thwart it, (vide <a href="/doc/1014408/" id="a_24">State
     of Uttar Pradesh v. District Judge, Unnao &amp; Ors</a>., (AIR 1984 SC
     1401). The very purpose of such constitutional powers being
     conferred on the High Courts is that no man should be subjected
     to injustice by violating the law. The look out of the High Court is,
     therefore, not merely to pick out any error of law through an
     academic angle but to see whether injustice has resulted on
     account of any erroneous interpretation of law. If justice became
     the byproduct of an erroneous view of law the High Court is not
     expected to erase such justice in the name of correcting the error
     of law."
</p>
<p id="p_32">     We were also referred to a Division Bench of this Court in
     W.A.No.2430 of 2002 in which the aforesaid judgment of the
     Supreme Court has been followed and it was held that the court
     cannot erase justice done in the name of correcting error of law.
