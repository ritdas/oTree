<p id="p_1">         The instant petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">section 482</a> Cr.P.C. has been
preferred challenging the proceedings in Criminal Case No.13 &amp; 14 of
1993 (U.P. Pollution Control Board Vs. Ansal Papers and others)
pending in the court of Special Judicial Magistrate Pollution,
Lucknow along with the orders dated 23.04.2005, passed by the
Special Judicial Magistrate, Pollution and order dated 15.5.2007
passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Lucknow. It has further been
prayed that the operation of the order dated 1.4.2005 through which
non-bailable warrants and proceedings under <a href="/doc/1598801/" id="a_2">Section 82</a> Cr.P.C. which
have been directed to be initiated against the petitioners be stayed.
</p><p id="p_2">      Background facts in nutshell are as follows;
</p><p id="p_3">      The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974
(hereinafter to be referred to as the Act) came into existence on
23.03.1974 to ensure that the domestic and industrial effluents are not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>

allowed to be discharged into the water courses without adequate
treatment.
</p><p id="p_4">      The State Board for Control of Pollution was constituted on
3.2.1975 by the Government of U.P. under the Act and it has been
named as U.P. Pollution Control Board (hereinafter to be referred to as
the Board). M/s Ansal Papers, Sikandrabad, Bulandshahar was a unit
of Ansal Properties &amp; Infrastructure Limited within the meaning of the
<a href="/doc/185025414/" id="a_4">Section 47</a> of the Act (hereinafter referred to as the Company) which
was running a paper mill in district Bulandshahar.
</p><p id="p_5">      On 23.11.1983 a complaint under <a href="/doc/151283829/" id="a_5">Section 44</a> of the Act was
filed by the Board against the Company, its Managing Directors,
Occupiers including 10 persons alleging therein that M/s Ansal Papers
has been discharging knowingly its trade effluents into the Karva river
through drain without obtaining the consent of        the Board under
<a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_6">Section 25</a> r/w <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_7">Section 26</a> of the Act. The aforesaid complaint was
filed in the year 1983 and then later on it was transferred to Lucknow
before the Special Judicial Magistrate (Pollution), Lucknow in the
year 1993 where it was numbered as Case No.13 of 1993.
</p><p id="p_6">      In the year 1984 U.P. Pollution Control Board submitted another
application under <a href="/doc/146660715/" id="a_8">Section 33(1)</a> of the Act before the Additional
Munsif Magistrate, Bulandshahar against Ansal Paper Mills for
contravening the provisions of <a href="/doc/35230679/" id="a_9">Section 24</a> of the Act on which on
24.3.1984, the Additional Munsif Magistrate, Bulandshahar restrained
M/s. Ansal Papers to dispose of the pollutants in the river Karva and it
was further directed that the opposite parties i.e. Ansal Papers may
dispose of the polluted effluents as per standard measures directed by
the Board. On 02.01.1985 the officers of U. P. Pollution Control Board
again inspected the premises of the paper mills and found that the
paper mill was still discharging its trade effluent in the river Karva,
which was noxious in nature. Further on 22.05.1985 again the team of
board inspected the premises and found that the paper mill was still
discharging its trade effluents in the river Karva, disobeying the orders
of the Court dated 24.03.1984 passed by the Additional Munsif
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    3</span>

Magistrate-III, Bulandshahar. Accordingly, another complaint under
<a href="/doc/30355/" id="a_10">Section 41(2)</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1974 was filed before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bulandshahar
against Ansal Paper Mill, its Managing Director and other Directors
etc. for continuously violating the order dated 24.03.1984 passed by
the Learned Additional Munsif Magistrate, Bulandshahar under
<a href="/doc/10435539/" id="a_12">Section 33(2)</a> of the Act     and for contravening the provisions of
<a href="/doc/35230679/" id="a_13">Section 24</a> of the Act. The aforesaid complaint which was later on
registered as case no. 2207/89 was also transferred to Lucknow before
the Special Judicial Magistrate (Pollution) Lucknow in the year 1993,
where it was numbered as case no. 14/1993.
</p><p id="p_7">      Ansal Paper Factory was closed in the year 1987 and ceased to
carry out the production and any other business activity with effect
from 02.06.1987. The applicants challenged the aforesaid complaints
filed in the court of C. J.M., Bulandshahar by means of a Criminal
Miscellaneous Application No. 10260/1986 before the High Court and
the same was decided on 10.04.1987.
</p><p id="p_8">      On 28.01.1988 in pursuance of order dated 10.04.1987, passed
by this Court, the applicants filed an application before the Court of
C.J.M., Bulandshahar informing that one Mr. A. B. Sen was appointed
as occupier of Ansal Papers by a resolution passed by the Board of
Directors dated 30.09.1985 with effect from 12.08.1985. In the
resolution, it was clarified that Mr. A. B. Sen had been given the
charge due to the fact that the prior occupier Mr. R. C. Rastogi has
resigned from the company. It was stated in the application that Mr. A.
B. Sen was solely responsible and was in full control of the factory
and it was further requested that the accused persons, (the petitioners
before this Court) to appear through counsel and they may be
exempted from personal appearance. On 14.06.1988, in pursuance and
compliance of order dated 10.04.1987 of this Court, the learned
C.J.M., Bulandshahar exempted personal appearance of the petitioners
and others till further orders. On 27.02.1989, the Court of Special
Judicial Magistrate (Pollution) was constituted at Lucknow and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     4</span>

aforesaid pending cases in the Court of C.J.M., Bulandshahar, were
transferred and    numbered as case nos. 13/93 and 14/93.             On
10.05.2004, an application was moved by the petitioners before
Special Judicial Magistrate at Lucknow for dismissing the complaint
on the ground that the complaints were not filed through the person
duly authorized by the Board. The application was dismissed on
21.08.1990; aggrieved by the order dated 21.08.1990, a Criminal
Revision was filed before the Court which was registered at Criminal
Revision No. 1556 of 1990 in which an interim order dated
04.09.1990 was passed staying the proceedings pending before the
Magistrate. The said revision was dismissed on 10.05.2004 and as a
consequence of the dismissal of the above revision the learned Special
Magistrate issued summons vide order dated 01.10.2004 fixing
27.10.2004 for appearance despite the fact that in compliance of the
order dated 10.04.1987 passed by this Court, the learned C.J.M.,
Bulandshahar on 14.06.1988 exempted personal appearance of the
petitioners. On 27.10.2004, learned Magistrate issued non-bailable
warrants despite the fact that the summons were not received/served
upon the applicants. Thereafter on 09.03.2005, an application under
<a href="/doc/185025414/" id="a_14">Section 47</a> of the Act read with <a href="/doc/1521732/" id="a_15">Section 245(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1108335/" id="a_16">305</a> Cr.P.C. was
filed before the concerned Court in pursuance of the order dated
10.04.1987 passed by this Court in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.
10260 of 1986. Another application for staying/suspension of the
execution of non-bailable warrants was also filed. It was also brought
to notice that an application dated 28.01.1988 pursuant to the order
dated 10.04.1987 was filed before the Magistrate naming Mr. A. B.
Sen as a person responsible for day-to-day affairs of the factory and it
was also prayed that the applicants be discharged. It was also stated
that upon filing of the said application, learned C.J.M, exempted the
appearance of the applicants till further orders. It is alleged that the
order is still operative. It has not been recalled, as such the applicants
prayed for discharge.
</p><p id="p_9">      On 09.03.2005, the application was heard and objections were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    5</span>

invited. Thereafter on 01.04.2005, the counsel for the applicants was
ill as a result of which an application for adjournment was moved
through his junior. Instead of adjourning the matter or disposing of the
aforesaid applications of the applicants, the learned Magistrate vide
order dated 01.04.2005 issued non-bailable warrants against the
petitioners and decided to proceed against the applicants under the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1598801/" id="a_17">Section 82</a> Cr.P.C. An application was moved for staying
the execution of non-bailable warrants and the proceedings under
<a href="/doc/1598801/" id="a_18">section 82</a> Cr.P.C. but no orders could be passed by the learned
Magistrate. On 23.04.2005, the application which was moved before
the Magistrate in pursuance of the order dated 10.04.1987 of this
Court was dismissed without fixing liability.      On 15.05.2007, the
revision filed against the above order was also dismissed on technical
ground that the application was not signed by the applicants. Thus
both the courts failed to comply the order dated 10.04.1987 passed by
this Court.
</p><p id="p_10">      The petitioners have raised following contentions in the petition
filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_19">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. The judgment and order of the High
Court dated 10.4.1987 which reads as under has not been complied
with and the order passed on the application moved by the petitioners
is erroneous:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "Heard the learned counsel for the parties. This
      application is devoid of any merit. However, it is open to
      the company to inform the court by filing an application
      about the names of persons or person who at the time of
      occurrence was in-charge and was responsible for the
      company and for the conduct of the company. The
      Magistrate after considering the said application if filed
      shall proceed with the case against only those persons
      who at the time of the offence were in-charge and were
      responsibl3e to the company for the conduct of the
      company as mentioned under <a href="/doc/185025414/" id="a_20">Section 47</a> of the water
      (Prevention and    <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_21">Control of the Pollution) Act</a> 1974.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      The learned Magistrate shall       not be influenced by the
      observation made by the revisional court. With these
      directions the application is rejected. The applicants who
      are out of country may appear before the            learned
      Magistrate through counsel."</blockquote>

<p id="p_11">      The learned Magistrate on 23.4.2005 dismissed the application
without any justification and the revision in pursuance of the order
was also not properly considered and was dismissed without any
justification on 15.5.2007. In this regard, it is submitted that the order
dated 10.4.1987 passed by this Court referred to above specifically
directing the company to inform the trial court by filing an application
about the names of persons or person who at the time of occurrence
was in-charge and was responsible for the affairs of company and for
the conduct of the company. It was also directed that after considering
the said application, the trial court shall proceed against the said
persons or person, who was in-charge as aforesaid.        It is submitted
that the order of the High Court was based on the provisions of Sub-
section 5 of Section 305 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_22">Cr.P.C</a>. where a statement in writing
purported to be signed by the Managing Director of the company or by
any person having or being one of the persons of the Management of
the affairs of the Corporation to the effect that the persons named in
the statement has been appointed as the representative of the
corporation for the purposes of this section. The court has to presume
that such person has been appointed. <a href="/doc/1108335/" id="a_23">Section 305</a> of Cr.P.C. reads as
under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (1) In this section, "corporation" means an incorporated
      company      or other body corporate, and includes a
      society registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_24">Societies Registration Act</a>,
      1860 (21 of 1860).

<p id="p_12">      It is submitted that in the application dated 28.01.1988, 16.07.1990
and 09.03.2005, the petitioners informed that Mr. A. B. Sen was in-charge
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                     8</span>

of Ansal Papers Ltd., Bulandshahar, but the trial court in its order dated
23.04.2005 and the revisional court on 15.05.2007 merely took technical
view of the entire case. It is not only erroneous but is also against the
directions and mandate of the order dated 10.04.1987 of the Hon'ble High
Court. The application was rejected solely on the ground that the same
was not signed by the applicants. It is further averred that in view of the
provisions of law of Sub-section 5 of Section 305 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_25">Cr.P.C</a>. referred to
above coupled with directions of the Hon'ble High Court dated
10.04.1987, the Magistrate was bound to accept the information
regarding Sri A. B. Sen who was in-charge and occupier of Ansal Papers
Ltd., Bulandshahar. The learned Magistrate has not done so and the
revisional court also ignored this lapse in committing initial error
resulting in miscarriage of justice. The order dated 01.04.2005 passed by
the Special Judicial Magistrate (Pollution) Lucknow issuing non-bailable
warrants against the petitioners and initiating the proceedings under
<a href="/doc/1598801/" id="a_26">Section 82</a> Cr.P.C. were totally unwarranted and uncalled for since the
summons were not served on the applicants and they were not the
absconders and were appearing in the Court through their counsel as per
order of the High Court and their personal appearance were exempted by
Judicial Magistrate on 14.06.1988. The order was not vacated,
accordingly the order dated 01.04.2005, passed by the Special Judicial
Magistrate (Pollution) Lucknow is ab initio and illegal and on the face of
it is violative of the mandatory provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1598801/" id="a_27">Section 82</a> Cr.P.C.
The Magistrate has failed to follow the procedure provided under the law
by passing the order dated 01.04.2005. The Magistrate has also not paid
any heed to the directions and guidelines issued by this Court vide
judgment and order dated 10.04.1987 (Annexure-3). Therefore, the
Magistrate could proceed in the case only after determining as to who
was actual offender. It is urged that the magistrate has not yet determined
or decided as to who was the actual offender and thus has not complied
with the judgment and order dated 10.04.1987 passed in Criminal Misc.
Case No. 10260 of 1986 which is an abuse of process of law. The
application dated 28.01.1988 was moved in pursuant to the order dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                      9</span>

10.04.1987 before the Magistrate naming Sri A. B. Sen as a person
responsible for day-to-day affairs of the company. It is further submitted
that Sri A. B. Sen was in-charge and responsible for day-to-day affairs of
the company and this fact remained uncontroverted. Thus, the fact
admitted to the Board had to be accepted by the Magistrate that Sri A. B.
Sen was in-charge and responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the
company. But the learned Magistrate left this fact untouched and decided
other affairs of the company without any justification. Thus, there is
abuse of process of law in this case. It is further submitted that the
application was dismissed on technical ground and non-bailable warrants
were issued on 01.04.2005 along with initiation of proceedings under
<a href="/doc/1598801/" id="a_28">section 82</a> Cr.P.C. without any justification. Accordingly, the order dated
23.04.2005 and 15.05.2007 passed by the learned Magistrate and
Additional Sessions Judge are wholly arbitrary and without jurisdiction.
It is further submitted that the proceedings of criminal case may be kept
in abeyance so far as the applicants are concerned and operation of order
dated 01.04.2005 be stayed. On behalf of opposite party no. 2 (Pollution
Board), counter affidavit was filed to the effect that in view of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_29">section 47</a>
of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_30">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, accused
persons being director and occupier were responsible for the affairs of the
company and liable for their acts under <a href="/doc/185025414/" id="a_31">Section 47</a> of the Act. Further the
judgment and order dated 10.04.1987 of this Court passed in Criminal
Misc. Case No. 10260 of 1986 and the application filed in pursuance of
the judgment and order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate dated
14.06.1988 exempting the personal appearance of the petitioners have
been admitted by the Board in the counter affidavit.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      It has further been urged that order dated 23.04.2005 and
15.05.2007 passed by the Special Judicial Magistrate (Pollution)
Lucknow and Additional Sessions Judge, Lucknow have not challenged
before this Court and they have become final and accordingly, application
under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_32">section 482</a> Cr.P.C. is not maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      In the rejoinder affidavit it is submitted that the sample was not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                      10</span>

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_34">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and notice was not given.
Accordingly, it cannot be said that the company discharged effluent in the
river. It has further been urged that the order of inspection had neither sent
nor served upon the company. The Magistrate ought to have proceeded
against Sri A. B. Sen and ought to have construed that the petitioners
have not looking after the affairs of the company. At the time of taking the
sample Sri A. B. Sen was the person responsible for day-to-day affairs of
the company. Thus, the proceedings conducted by the Magistrate are
flagrant breach of law and deliberate violation of order dated 10.04.1987.
Accordingly, the orders are not tenable in the eyes of law and liable to be
quashed. Thus, the petitioners have approached this Court under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_35">Section
482</a> Cr.P.C. seeking the following reliefs:-

<p id="p_17">      6.       That in accordance with the provisions laid down

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                 12</span>

accused company is required to submit an application for
consent of the State Board in prescribed form alongwith the
particulars regarding the construction, installation and
operation of the industrial and commercial establishment or
of any treatment and disposal system and such other
particular as prescribed under law.
</p>
<p id="p_18">9.     That the complainant Board by means of its letter
dated 12.5.81 issued to the aforesaid company, has pointed
out certain discrepancies in the consent seeking application
as the same was incomplete in many respects.
</p>
<p id="p_19">11.    That in view of the aforesaid report dated 20.06.81
and also taking into account that the company had no proper
arrangement for treatment of their effluents and complete
details have not been furnished with the consent seeking
application, the complainant board was left with no other
alternative than to refuse the consent prayed for in the public
interest. The consent was accordingly refused by the
complainant board by means of its registered letter no.
7051/C/Ansal Papers Mills/9 dated 07.08.81. In the
aforesaid letter it was directed that the company may again
apply for the consent within 30 days without paying any
further fee for the consent .
</p>
<p id="p_20">15.    That after 11.01.82 the accused opposite parties have
not applied for the consent and are discharging their highly
polluted trade effluents without obtaining consent of the
complainant Board. The aforesaid industry was again
informed of his liabilities under the aforesaid Act and it has
also been asked from the opposite parties that why the
prosecution proceedings may not be initiated against them,
but all the efforts made by the Board have become futile.
</p>
<p id="p_21">16.    That on 14.09.1983 the officers of the Board again
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                               13</span>

inspected the site of the aforesaid company after giving the
proper notices as prescribed under the rules and Sri R. S.
Rastogi, the General Manager or the aforesaid company
was present at the time of inspection. A report dated
15.09.1983 sent by the regional office of the Board in this
connection clearly shows that the opposite parties have been
discharging their trade effluents without obtaining consent of
the Board and without having proper treatment plant so that
the effluent may conform the standard laid by the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_22">18.    That inspite of repeated request the accused company
did not apply for obtaining the consent of the state Board. A
fresh u/s 25(1) read with <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_43">section 26</a> of the Act uptill now.
Thus the accused company has violated the provisions of
<a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_44">Section 25</a>/<a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_45">26</a> of the Act and is liable to be punished under

company are responsible for continuance commissioning of
offence under <a href="/doc/151283829/" id="a_47">Section 44</a> of this Act. Because the formalities
for obtaining consent under Act and construction of effluent
treatment plant can be taken only when these senior partners
of the company resolve to do so. Offence mentioned in the
complaint is being continuously committed against the
society at large, animals and aquatic life in particular
because of their personal monetary gains. It is therefore,
prayed that all directors and manager of the company be
summoned and punished according to law.
</p>
<p id="p_24">22.    That all the directors and partners of the factory are
liable for the offence being committed by the factory as the
formalities for obtaining consent under the provision of the
Act such as construction of proper treatment plant etc. are
policy matter and cannot be taken up in hand without the

      members of the Board of Directors of M/s Ansal Papers
      Factory alongwith others are liable for the offence
      committed under <a href="/doc/151283829/" id="a_48">section 44</a> by not obtaining the consent of
      the Board as required by <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_49">section 25</a>/<a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_50">26</a> of the Act.

<p id="p_25">      23.   That under the provision of <a href="/doc/185025414/" id="a_51">Section 47</a> of the Act
      where an offence under this Act has been committed by a
      company, every person who at the time the offence was
      committed was incharge and was responsible to the company
      for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the
      company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and
      shall be liable to proceeded against           and punished
      accordingly. Then the accused persons are liable to be

      provision of <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_53">Section 25</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      The relevant paragraphs of another complaint (Annexure-1) are
reproduced as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">      6.    That in order to check that whether the industry is
      complying the order passed by the Court under <a href="/doc/96367367/" id="a_54">Section 33</a>
      (2) on 24.03.84 or not         the site of M/s. Ansal Papers,

      the Board Sri Dinesh Chand Assistant Environmental
      Engineer on 2.1.85 in the presence of the representative of
      company after giving due notice for inspection to the
      opposite parties. According to the report the industry is
      discharging its polluted trade effluent into the stream in
      contravention of the order of the Court. The notice of sample
      and the inspection report are enclosed herewith as Annexure
      No. 2 &amp; 3 to this complaint.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">      7.    That sample of the effluent was also taken by the said

      representative of the accused opposite parties after giving
      due notice and he same was got analyzed from the
      laboratory   properly. The analysis report dated 2.1.85
      clearly shows that all the material parameters of the trade
      effluent of M/s. Ansal Papers, Sikandrabad, Bulandshahar
      are much high than the standards laid down by the
      complainant Board &amp; do not confirm to the standard
      prescribed. The copy of the standard prescribed by the
      Board and the said analysis report is being filed herewith as
      Annexure No. 4 &amp; 5 to the complaint.

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">      8.    That the site of M/s. Ansal Papers, Sikandrabad,
      Bulandshahar was again inspected by the officer of the
      Board on 22.5.85 and it was found that the accused opposite
      parties are continuously discharging their highly polluting
      trade effluent still without proper treatment into the river
      Karva in contravention of the order dated 24.3.84 of the
      court under <a href="/doc/10435539/" id="a_55">section 33(2)</a>. The copy of the said inspection

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">      9.    That from the above submission evidence it is clear
      that the accused opposite parties have violated and
      continuously violating every moment the order and
      directions given by the Hon'ble Court u/s 33 of the said Act
      and so they have rendered themselves liable for the
      prosecution u/s 41 (2) of the aforesaid Act and should be
      punished according to law.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_27">14.   That under the provisions of <a href="/doc/113448045/" id="a_56">section 47(1)</a> of the aforesaid Act
for the offence company every person who at the time the offence was
committed was in charge of and was responsible to the company for
the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the company,
shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be

proceeded against the punished accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_28">      Thus, the Board moved two separate complaints against the
officers of the company for their prosecution. It transpires that petitioner
no. 1 is Managing Director of the company, petitioner no. 2 is the
occupier of the company and petitioner no. 3 is the Director of the
company. The Board is of the view that in view of <a href="/doc/185025414/" id="a_57">Section 47</a> of the Act
they are liable for prosecution. It is further urged that accused-company is
represented by the Managing Director and the accused company is
attributable to take care with regard to the mandatory provision. But the
accused persons have failed to take care of the same. In this context it
may be specified that at this stage it would not be expedient in the interest
of justice to quash the complaints (Annexures No. 1 &amp; 2) for the reason
that the complainant and the petitioners themselves prayed for keeping
the proceedings of criminal case in abeyance till such time the order is not
passed in accordance with law by the Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_29">      The attention of this Court was drawn on the judgment and order
dated 10.04.1987 referred to above wherein it was directed that the
company had to inform by filing an application about the names of
persons/person who at the time of occurrence was in-charge and was
responsible for the conduct of the company. It was further directed that
the said application if filed the Magistrate shall decide the same and pass
orders against only those persons who at the time of the offence was
incharge and responsible for the affairs of the company in view of
Provision of <a href="/doc/185025414/" id="a_58">Section 47</a> of the Act. The applicants were directed to
appear before the Magistrate through counsel. It has been urged by the
petitioners that this order has not been complied with and orders passed
by Special Judicial Magistrate and learned Additional Sessions Judge
dated 23.04.2005 and 15.05.2007 are erroneous and the same may be
quashed along with the order issued by the Magistrate on 01.04.2005 and
proceeding against the applicants is in contravention of the order of this
Court and against the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_59"> of Criminal Procedure Code</a> initiating
the proceeding under <a href="/doc/1598801/" id="a_60">Section 82</a> Cr.P.C. and also issuing non-bailable
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                      17</span>

warrants against them, despite the fact that summons were not served.
Thus, at this stage it would not be expedient to quash the proceedings
specifically when there is no prayer to this effect and prayer is only to the
effect that the proceedings in criminal case be kept in abeyance. Even
otherwise also in view of the averments made in the complaints referred
to above, it is clear that at the time of issuing the process the Magistrate
was mainly concerned with the allegations made in the complaint or the
evidence led in support of the same and he is only prima facie to be
satisfied whether there is sufficient ground to proceed against the
petitioners or not. In this context, in view of <a href="/doc/185025414/" id="a_61">Section 47</a> of the Act and the
averments made      in the complaints the Magistrate issued summons
against the complaints.
</p><p id="p_30">        Learned counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance over
Municipal Corporation of Delhi Vs. Ram Kishan Rohtagi and others,
(1983) 1 SCC 1. In this case the Hon'ble Apex Court considered the
scope of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_62">Section 482</a> and evolved guidelines as to how inherent power
should be exercised by the High Court to quash the trial. After going
through case, it transpires that in this case the complaint was filed
before Metropolitan Magistrate, who summoned all the respondents
for being tried for violating the provisions of <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_63">Food Adulteration Act</a>.
The said complaint was filed against them for having committed
offence under <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_64">section 7</a>/<a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_65">16</a> of the aforesaid. In this context it transpires
that the instant case has no bearing for the reason that <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_66">Section 47</a> of
Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_67">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 has a different
dimensions. Consequently, the law as laid down by the Hon'ble Apex
Court in the matter of       <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_68">Prevention of Food Adulteration Act</a> has
absolutely no bearing on the facts of the case especially under the
circumstances that the law referred to above has also been considered
several times by the Hon'ble Apex Court and was not applied in the
matter of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_69">Water Pollution Act</a>. Consequently, the petitioners can not
take advantage of the aforesaid Act for getting the complaints
quashed.
</p><p id="p_31">      It would be noticed that sub-Section (1) of <a href="/doc/185025414/" id="a_70">Section 47</a> is much
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                    18</span>

wider than sub-Section 4 of Section 17 of <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_71">Food Adulteration Act</a>,
1954. Proviso to sub-Section (1) shifts the burden on the delinquent
officer or servant of the company responsible for the commission of
the offence. The burden is on him to prove that he did not know of the
offence or connived in it or they had exercised all due diligence to
prevent the commission of such offence. The non obstante clause in
sub-Section (2) expressly provides that notwithstanding anything
contained is sub-section (1), where an offence under the Act has been
committed by a company and it is proved that the offence has been
committed with the consent or connivance of, or, is attributable to any
neglect on the part of any director, manager, secretary or other officer
of the company, such director, manager, secretary or other officer shall
also be deemed to be guilty of that offence, and shall be liable to
proceed against and punished accordingly.
</p><p id="p_32">       Learned counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance on State
of Haryana Vs. Brij Lal Mittal and others, (1998) 5 SCC 343, wherein
it was held that the court has to weigh the vicarious liability of a
person for being prosecuted for an offence committed under the Drugs
and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_72">Cosmetics Act</a>, 1940 and a Director will not be responsible if
there is no allegation to indicate that he was dealing with the affairs of
the complaint. This ruling too is not applicable to the facts of the
present case for the reason that in the complaint specific averments
have been made against the petitioners that they were responsible for
discharging the trade effluents in river Karva which was noxious in
nature. This ruling too is not applicable for the facts of the case.
Consequently, the petitioners cannot take any advantage of making a
submission on the strength of the aforesaid case law for getting the
aforesaid complaints quashed. Needless to say that the complicity of
the petitioners in this case and the averments made in the complaints
prima facie constitute offence which cannot be ignored at this stage.
However, it is for the trial court to weigh the evidence at the time of
framing the charge.
</p><p id="p_33">      Lastly, the petitioners have relied over <a href="/doc/832836/" id="a_73">National Small Industries
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                   19</span>

Corporation Ltd. vs. Harmeet Singh Paintal and another</a>, (2010) 3 SCC
</p><p id="p_34">330. In this case a complaint was made against the Director under the
<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_74">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>, 1881. The Hon'ble Apex Court held that
in a case of dishonour of cheque, the director would not be held
responsible on the basis of mere bald statement that he was in-charge
and was responsible to the company for the conduct of its business.
This ruling is also not applicable as scope of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_75">Section 47</a> of Water
Pollution Act provide a distinct, specific and different vicarious
liability of the Managing Director, Directors etc referred to above.
Consequently, the averments made in the complaints cannot be
brushed aside. However, on behalf of the petitioners further reliance
has been placed on the decisions of Smt. Manibai and Another Vs.
The State of Maharashtra, (1974) 3 SCC 760 and R. Banerjee and
others Vs. H.D.Dubey and Other (1992) 2 SCC 552. These rulings
are of no avail and on the basis of the aforesaid case laws, the
petitioners cannot get the complaint quashed for the reasons that they
have no bearings on the facts of the present case. The petitioners have
placed reliance on Hari Shankar Jalan Vs. Food Inspector,
Cherukole and Others, 1997 SCC (Cri) 968 and P.Rajarathinam
Vs. State of Maharashtra and Others (2000) 10 SCC 529. These
rulings do not deal with the pollution matter. Learned counsel for the
petitioners has further relied over a decision of the Apex Court in
U.P.Pollution Control Board Vs. M/s Modi Distillery and Others
(Supra) and Nalin Thakor and others Vs. State of Gujarat and
Others (2003) 12 SCC 461. On the strength of the aforesaid case
laws, it has been urged that on account of non-application of mind in
issuing the summons the complaints were not cognizable. These
rulings too have no bearings on the facts of the case, as specific
averments have been made in the complaint and moreover the Hon'ble
Apex Court in U.P.Pollution Control Board Vs. Dr. Bhupendra
Kumar Modi and another (2009) 2 SCC 147 considered the scope of
these rulings and refused to quash the complaint.
    Consequently in view of the decision of the Hon'ble apex court at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                    20</span>

this stage the complaints are not liable to be quashed and this Court
cannot scrutinize evidence.
</p><p id="p_35">      Moreover,    the   Hon'ble Apex       Court   in   the   case   of
P.Rajarathinam Vs. State of Maharashtra and Others (Supra),
considered the scope of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_76">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. and took a view on the
point of vicarious liability as to who should answer the charge
depends upon the facts. It will be open for the concerned court to pass
appropriate order at the time of framing the charge and powers under
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_77">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. should not be invoked. Consequently, on the basis
of aforesaid rulings also the matter has to be left to the discretion of
the trial court to scrutinize th evidence at the time of framing the
charge but at this stage close scrutiny of the evidence is not
permissible by invoking the powers under inherent jurisdiction of this
Court. The powers under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_78">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. can only be invoked to
check the abuse of the process of law when there is no effective
alternative remedy to the applicant. While in this case, the proper
forum is the trial court where all the points can be agitated and the
trial court should take into consideration the entire subject matter and
thereafter on the basis of evidence on record and making scrutiny of
the matter decide to frame the charge or not but at this stage no
direction can be issued not to frame the charge or to quash the
complaint only on the ground that the petitioners' assertion that they
are not responsible for the day-to-day working of the company.
</p><p id="p_36">      As regards the contentions of the petitioners that no case is made
out against them in view of the case of Municipal Corporation of Delhi
Vs. Ram Kishan Rohtagi and others, AIR 1983 SC 67, I find that the
three Judge Bench of Hon'ble Apex Court in U.P. Pollution Control
Board Vs. Dr. Bhupendra Kumar Modi &amp; Anr., 2009 CRI. L.J. 1148
considered the scope of each and every case cited by the petitioners and
thereafter took a view that in a case of environmental matter the court
should not exercise power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_79">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. for quashing the
complaint as a court of revision and appeal. The inherent jurisdiction
though wide has to be exercised carefully and with caution. The High
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                        21</span>

Court could not ordinarily embark upon an enquiry whether the evidence
in question is reliable or not or whether on a reasonable appreciation of it
accusation would not be sustained. Relevant para 21 reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">       "21. It is our endeavour to point out that the High Court
       has quashed the complaint arising in an environmental
       matter in a casual manner by exercising power under
       <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_80">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C. This Court has held exercise of

       exception and under the rule there are three circumstances
       under which the inherent jurisdiction may be exercised i.e.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">       (a) to give effect to an order of the Court; (b) to prevent
       abuse of the process of the Court; (c) to otherwise secure the
       ends of justice. Ity is true that it is neither possible nor
       desirable to lay down any inflexible rule which would
       govern the exercise of inherent jurisdiction.              While
       exercising inherent powers either on civil or criminal
       jurisdiction, the Court does not function as a Court of
       Appeal or Revision. The inherent jurisdiction though wide
       has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution. It
       should be exercised to do real and substantial justice and if
       any attempt is made to abuse that authority so as to produce
       injustice, the Court has power to prevent abuse. When no
       offence is disclosed by the complaint, the Court may
       examine the question of fact. When complaint is sought to
       be quashed, it is permissible to look into the materials to
       assess what the complainant had alleged and whether any
       offence is made out even if the allegations are accepted in
       toto. When exercising jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_83">Section 482</a> of the
       Code, the High Court could not ordinarily embark upon an
       enquiry whether the evidence in question is reliable or not or
       whether on a reasonable appreciation of it accusation would
       not be sustained. To put it clear, it is the function of the trial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                     22</span>

      Judge to do so. The Court must be careful to see that its
      decision in exercise of its power is based on sound
      principles. The inherent power should not be exercised to
      stifle a legitimate prosecution. If the allegations set out in
      the complaint do not constitute offence of which cognizance
      has been taken by the Magistrate, it is open to the High
      Court to quash the same in exercise of the inherent powers
      under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_84">Section 482</a> of the Criminal           Procedure Code.
      However, it is not necessary that there should be meticulous
      analysis of the case before the trial to find out whether the
      case would end in conviction or acquittal. "</blockquote>

<p id="p_37">      In this context, it would be relevant to refer a Full Bench Decision
of this Court in Ajeet Singh Vs. State of U.P., 2007 CriLJ 170. Relevant
para 57 reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">             "The normal process of the criminal trial cannot be
      cut short in a rather casual manner.       The court, is not
      justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or
      genuineness of the allegations made in the FIR or the
      complaint on the basis of the      evidence collected during
      investigation only while dealing with a petition...    seeking
      the quashing of the FIR and the criminal proceedings."</blockquote>

<p id="p_38">      In the case of Hamida Vs. Rashid, (2008) 1 SCC 474 the Hon'ble
Apex Court also laid down certain norms as to how the power of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_85">section
482</a> Cr.P.C. has to be exercised which reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">             "Inherent powers of High Court has to be exercised
      sparingly     with circumspection and in rare cases and that
      too to correct patent illegalities or when some miscarriage
      of justice is done. Practice of High Courts in entertaining
      petitions under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_86">Section 482</a> when there was an effective
      alternative remedy available has been deprecated. Ends of
      justice would be better served if valuable time of the Court is

       are often filed with some oblique motive in order to

       which enable the accused to win over the witnesses by
       money or muscle power or they may become disinterested in
       giving evidence, ultimately resulting in miscarriage of
       justice."</blockquote>

<p id="p_39">      In view of the above proposition of law, it is abundantly clear that
prima facie on the basis of allegations made in the complaint it would not
be expedient in the interest of justice to weigh the evidence and proceed
in the manner as suggested by the learned counsel for the petitioners. At
this stage, it would also not be expedient to embark upon the merits of
the case. Accordingly, at this stage the prayer for quashing the criminal
complaints in Criminal Case No. 13 &amp; 14 of 1993 (U.P. Pollution Control
Board Vs. Ansal Papers Ltd. &amp; Others) is not tenable and this court
declines to quash the proceedings of Criminal Case No. 13 &amp; 14 of 1993
(U.P. Pollution Control Board Vs. Ansal Papers Ltd. &amp; Others) against
the petitioners. Thus, prayer no. 1 of the petitioner is not found tenable in
the eyes of law.

wherein it has been urged that Sri A. B. Sen is the sole person responsible

against him and the same was not done. Thus, in view of <a href="/doc/249603/" id="a_89">Section 47</a> of
the Cr.P.C., it was incumbent on the Magistrate to issue process against
Sri A. B. Sen in accordance with provisions of law. As regards complicity
of the applicants in this case, the attention of this Court was drawn for
non-compliance of the order dated 10.04.1987 of this Court which has
been referred (supra). It is mandatory on the trial court to comply with on
the principle of stare decisis. The order has to be complied with on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                      24</span>

principle of stare decisis.
</p><p id="p_41">       The learned counsel for the petitioners has drawn the attention of
this Court on the judgment and order dated 10.4.1987 passed by this
Court wherein it was directed that the company had to inform by filing an
application about the names of the persons who at the time of occurrence
was in-charge and was responsible for the conduct of the company. It
was further directed that the said application if filed, the Magistrate shall
decide the same and pass orders against only those persons who at the
time of the offence was in-charge and responsible for the affairs of the
company in view of provision of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_90">Section 47</a> of the Act. The applicants
were directed to appear before the Magistrate through counsel. In view of
the order referred to above (supra), the applications were moved before
the court of Special Judicial Magistrate and the same was dismissed and
thereafter revision was preferred and the same was also dismissed on
15.5.2007 by Additional Sessions Judge. It has been prayed that the
orders are erroneous and thus have not been passed in accordance with
the directions of this Court. Accordingly, till such time the order dated
10.4.1987 may be complied with and the further proceedings in Criminal
Case No. 13 and 14 of 1993 may be kept in abeyance. The attention of
this Court has further been drawn to this fact that Shri A.B. Sen is the
sole person responsible for the commission of the offence and the trial
court ought to have proceeded against him, but the same was not done. It
has further been averred that in view of provision of <a href="/doc/1809911/" id="a_91">Section 305(5)</a>
Cr.P.C. referred to above, the company has filed the resolution before the
court of learned Magistrate specifying the liability of Shri A.B. Sen, but
the same was not considered. It was incumbent upon the Special Judicial
Magistrate and the Court of Sessions to look into the matter and pass
appropriate orders fixing the liability on the person concerned.      In this
context, it appears that the matter falls within the ambit of principles of
stare decicis. The principle of stare decicis applies with full force for the
reasons that the finality has to be attached with the order dated 10.4.1987
passed by this Court. The order has become final. The lower courts were
bound to comply with the direction of this Court. Let me understand the

</p>
<p id="p_42">      Dias on Jurisprudence Ed. 1964 in Mitra's Legal and
commercial Dictionary 2nd Edition, 1976 defines the phrase 'Stare
Decisis' as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">      Stare Decisis. The common law doctrine is stare decisis,
      derived from stare decisis et non quieta movere. It is
      different from the broad doctrine of precedent prevalent in
      all developed systems in that if certain conditions are
      fulfilled, an English Judge has either to follow the
      previous decision or else to distinguish it; while in the
      continental systems, his counterpart may seek guidance
      from past decisions, but is not bound to follow them.</blockquote>

<p id="p_43">             The doctrine of 'stare decisis' differs also from that of res
judicata in the following ways:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">          (1) Res judicata applies to the decision in the dispute, while
             stare decisis operates as to the rule of law involved.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">          (2) The former binds only the parties and their successors,
             whereas the latter binds everyone.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">          (3) Res judicata applies to all Courts, but stare decisis is
             brought into operation only by the decisions of higher
             Courts.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">          (4) The former takes effect after the time for appeal is past;
             the latter operates at once.</blockquote>

<p id="p_44">      Further, The Law Lexicon, 2nd Edition, Reprint 2002 defines
the phrase 'Stare Decisis' as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">             A-bid-by the decisions; (see 1 B1. Com. 70); a latin
      phrase meaning "to stand by decided cases; to uphold

      were the same points come again in litigation.

<blockquote id="blockquote_30">            It is a general maxim that when a point a law has
      been settled by decision, it forms a precedent which is
      not afterwards to be departed from. The Rule as stated
      is"to abide by former precedents (stare decisis), where
      the same points come again in litigation as well to keep
      the scale of justice even and steady, and not liable to
      waver with every new judge's opinion, as also because,
      the law in that case being solemnly declared and
      determined, what before was uncertain and perhaps
      indifferent, is now become a permanent rule, which it is
      not in the breast of any subsequent judge to alter or
      swerve from according to his private sentiments; he being
      sworn to determine not according to his own private
      judgment., but according to the known; laws and customs

      the same evidence, and if one of       them is acquitted
      for whatever may be the reason and the other is

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">     "32 This Court in Muktul V. Manbhari, AIR 1957 SC
     918, explained the scope of the doctrine of stare decisis
     with reference to Halsbury's         Laws of England and
     Corpus Juris Secundum in the following             manner:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">            "Apart from any question as to the courts being of
     coordinate jurisdiction, a decision which has been
     followed for a long period of time, and has been acted
     upon by persons in the formation of contracts or in the
     disposition of their property, or in the general conduct of
     affairs, or in legal procedure or in other ways, will
     generally be followed by courts of higher authority than
     the court establishing the rule, even though the court
     before whom the matter arises afterwards might not
     have given the same decision had the question come
     before it originally. But the Supreme Appellate Court will
     not shrink from overruling a decision, or series of
     decisions, which establish a doctrine plainly outside the
     statute and outside the   common law, when no title and
     no contract will be shaken, no persons             can
     complain, and no general course of dealing be altered by
     the    remedy of a mistake."

<blockquote id="blockquote_34">      The same doctrine is thus explained in Corpus Juris Secundum-

      which has    become settled by a series of decisions
      generally is binding on the courts and should be followed
      in similar cases. This rule is based on expediency and
      public policy, and , although generally it should be
             strictly adhered to by the courts, it is not
      universally applicable."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">             Be it noted however that Corpus Juris Secundum
      adds a rider that

             'previous decisions should not be followed to the
      extent that grievous wrong may result; and, accordingly,
      the courts ordinarily will not adhere to a rule or principle
      established by previous decisions which they are
      convinced is erroneous. The rule of stare decisis is not so
      imperative or inflexible as to preclude a departure
      therefrom in any    case, but its application must be
      determined in each case by the discretion of the court,
      and previous decisions should not be followed to the
      extent that error may be perpetuated and grievous wrong
      may result.'

             The     statement    though     deserves     serious
      consideration in the event of a definite finding as to the
      perpetration of a grave wrong but that by itself does not
      denude the time -tested doctrine of stare decisis of its

      "We are further of the view, that even if another
view is possible, we are not inclined to take a different
view at this distance of time. Interpretation of the law is
not a mere mental exercise. Things        which have been
adjudged long ago should be allowed to rest in peace. A
decision rendered long ago can be overruled only if this
Court comes to the conclusion that it is manifestly wrong
or unfair and not merely on the ground that another
interpretation is possible and the court may arrive at a
different conclusion. We should remember that the law
laid down by the High Court in the        above decision has
not been doubted so far. <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_94">The Act</a> in       question is a Stat
enactment. These are weighty considerations           to    hold
that even if a different view is possible, if it will have the
effect of upsetting or reopening past and closed
transactions or unsettling titles all over the State,       this
Court should be loathe to take a different view.

<p id="p_48">      On this ground as well, we are not inclined to
interfere with the judgment under appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_49">"35. In the wake of the aforesaid, we do feel it expedient
to record that taking recourse to the doctrine as above
would be an imperative      necessity,    so    as   to    avoid
uncertainty and confusion, since the basic feature of law
is its certainty and in the event of      any        departure
therefrom the society would be in utter confusion and the
resultant effect of which would be legal anarchy and
      judicial indiscipline- a situation which always
ought to be avoided. The Central Legislature introduced
the legislation     (MMRD Act) in the year 1957 and
several hundreds and       thousands of cases have already
been dealt with on the basis        thereof and the effect of a
declaration of a contra law would be totally         disastrous

      affecting the very basics of the revenue jurisprudence. It
      is true that the doctrine has no statutory sanction but it is
      a rule of convenience, expediency, prudence and       above
      all the public policy.     It is to be observed in its
            observance rather than in its breach to serve the
      people and subserve the ends of justice."

<p id="p_50">      This doctrine has also been followed by the Hon'ble Apex Court

Vs. Azadi Bachao Andolan and another, A.I.R. 2004 SC 1107 at

<p id="p_52">33.   The learned Attorney General justifiably relied on
the observations of this Court in <a href="/doc/191199/" id="a_99">Mishri Lal V. Dhirendra
Nath</a> (dead) by LRs. And others in which this Court
referred to its earlier decision in Mukrul V. Manbhari on
the scope of the doctrine of stare decisis with reference to
Halsbury's Law of England and Corpus Juris Secundum,
pointing out that a decision which has been followed for a
long period of time, and has been acted upon by persons
in the formation of contracts or in the disposition of their
property, or in the general conduct of affairs, or in legal
procedure or in other ways, will generally be followed by
courts of higher authority other than            the          court
establishing the rule, even though the court before whom
the   matter arises afterwards           might     be    of    a
      different view. The learned Attorney General
contended    that the interpretation given to <a href="/doc/68317/" id="a_100">Section 90</a> of
the Income-tax      Act, a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_101">Central Act</a>, by several        High
Courts without dissent has been uniformally followed;
several transactions have been entered into based upon
the said exposition of the law; that      several tax treaties
have been entered into with different foreign
Governments based upon this law, hence, the doctrine of
stare decisis should apply or else it will result in chaos
and   open up a Pandora's box of uncertainty.
</p>
<p id="p_53">34.   We think that this submission is sound and needs to
be    accepted.     It is not possible for us to say that the
judgments    of the different        High Courts noticed have
been wrongly decided by reason of         the           arguments
presented by the    respondents. As observed in Mishrilal
even if the High Courts have consistently taken an
erroneous view, (though we do not say that the view is
erroneous) it would be worthwhile to let the matter rest,

<p id="p_54">      Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Milkfood Ltd. Vs. M/s. GMC
Ice Cream (P) Ltd., A.I.R. 2004 SC 3145(1) has considered the scope

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">      72.   While interpreting a judgment this Court must pon-
      point its attention to the ratio thereof. A court of law must
      not lose sight of the doctrine of 'stare decisis'. A view

      not be disturbed only because another view is possible.

<blockquote id="blockquote_40">      73.   Keeping in view the fact that in all the decisions,

<p id="p_55">      Again the scope of principle of stare decicis has been
considered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1103956/" id="a_104">Sakshi V. Union
of India</a> and other, A.I.R. 2004 SC 3566. Paragraph No. 23 is relevant,
which reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">      23.   Stare decisis is a well known doctrine in legal
      jurisprudence. The doctrine of stare decisis, meaning to
      stand by decided cases, rests upon the principle that law
      by which men are governed should be fixed, definite and
      known, and that,    when the law is declared by Court of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                       33</span>

      competent jurisdiction authorised to construe it, such
      declaration, in absence of palpable mistake or error, is
      itself evidence of the law until changed        by   competent
      authority. It requires that rules of law when clearly
      announced and established by a Court of last resort
      should not be disregarded and set aside but should be
      adhered to and followed. What it precludes is that where
      a principle of law has become established by a series of
      decisions, it is binding on the Courts and should be
      followed in similar cases. It is a wholesome doctrine
      which gives certainty to law.</blockquote>

<p id="p_56">       Principle of stare decicis has been considered by the Hon'ble
Apex Court in the case of Iridium India Telecom Ltd. Vs. Motorola
Inc., A.I.R. 2005 SC 514(1). Relevant paragraph no. 40 is reproduced
as under :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_42">      40.     In our judgment, the principle of stare decisis
      squarely applies to the case on hand. In the first place, we
      are not satisfied that all the aforesaid judgments of the High
      Courts have been wrongly decided. Secondly, even assuming
      that it is possible to take a different view, as long as the
      principle has been consistently      followed by the majority of
      the High Courts in this country, as observed in Mishri Lal
      (supra), even if the High Courts consistently have taken an
      erroneous view, (though we do not see that the view is
      erroneous), it would be worthwhile to let the     matter   rest,
      since a large number of parties have modulated and
      continue to modulate their legal relationships based on the
      settled law. On this principle also the view taken by the
      Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay
      commends itself to us.</blockquote>

<p id="p_57">      Thus, in view of the Principles of Stare Decicis, the trial court and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                    34</span>

Court in the manner as directed by this Court on 10.4.1987. From a bare
reading of the impugned order dated 23.4.2005 and 15.5.2007, it
transpires that the applications were decided by the courts without
adhering the directions of this Court. <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_105">Section 47</a> of the Water Pollution

</p>
<p id="p_76">      <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_120">Section 47(1)</a> spells out a deeming fiction of vicarious liability
and a rule of evidence laying the burden of proof on persons in charge
of and responsible to the company for the conduct of its business. It is
settled beyond cavil that rules of evidence and deeming fictions are
not to be expressly spelt out and pleaded. They are matters which are
for consideration and application in the course of the trial. To required
that the complaint itself must plead a rule of evidence or, in terms
spell out a deeming fiction provided by the statute therein in an
argument bordering on hyper-technicality. One must always keep in
mind the broader perspective that the administration of criminal law is
more a matter of substance than of form and should not be allowed to
be obscured by pettifogging technicality. Now it is manifest from the
above that the categoric allegation in the evidence was that the
petitioner was the Managing Director of the company and this is a fact
which is undisputed on the record. The Managing Director of a
company from his very designation implies both the control and
command of the affairs of such a company and equally a statutory
liability to the company for responsible conduct of its business. It is a
compendious term, which signifies both control of and responsibility
to the company both in ordinary parlance and by virtue of the
provision of a person as a Managing Director of the company there
must be a further pleading that he is the person in charge thereof and is
responsible to it for the conduct of its business would suffer from the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                     39</span>

vice of literality of course, as the proviso, to <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_121">Section 47(1)</a> shows, it is
permitted even for a Managing Director to show that he did not have
any knowledge of the commission of the offence or that he acted with
the greatest diligence to prevent the same. But, the burden of proof is
laid upon him. The factum of being the managing Director of the
company is by itself sufficient to attract the provisions of <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_122">Section
47(1)</a> and the vicarious liability specified therein. The specific words
therein he was was in charge of and was responsible to the company
for the conduct of the business of the company are not a magic
incantation which, unless repeated, would vitiate a prosecution if the
substance of the matter is well spelt out either in the complaint itself
or in categoric terms by acceptable testimony. Thus, <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_123">Section 47(1)</a> of
the Act does not necessarily mandate the incorporation of the words.-
"was in charge of and was responsible to the company for the conduct
of the business of the company"-in all complaints against the
Chairman, the Managing Director or the General Manager of the
company for offences in contravention of the company for offences in
the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_77">      Section not mandate on corporation of words "was in charge of

the company. Consequently, to insist that in spite of the description of
a person as a Managing Director of the company there must be a
further pleading that he is the person in charge thereof and is
responsible to it for the conduct of its business would suffer from the
vice of laterality of course, as the proviso, to <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_124">Section 47(1)</a> shows, it is
permitted even for a Managing Director to show that he did not have
any knowledge of the commission of the offence or that he acted with
the greatest diligence to prevent the same. But the burden of proof is
laid upon him. The factum of being the Managing Director of the
company is by itself sufficient to attract the provisions of Sec. 47(1)
and the vicarious liability specified therein.       The specific words
therein he was in charge of and was responsible to the company for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                     40</span>

the conduct of the business of the company are not a magic incantation
which unless repeated, would vitiate a prosecution if the substance of
the matter is well spelt out either in the complaint itself or in categoric
terms by acceptable testimony.
</p>
<p id="p_78">       Unlike sub-section (1) which foists vicarious liability only on
persons in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of
its business, the sub-section imposes a somewhat similar liability on a
larger class of directors, managers, secretaries or even other officers of
the company. In a way this sub-section is envisaged to widen the net
of vicarious liability and to bring within its sweep not only the primal
official of the company but even other officers of thereof if the
commission of the offence by the company can be established to have
been done with the consent, connivance or neglect on their part. Thus,
the role and scope of sub-section (2) is somewhat different from that
of sub-section (1), the former being applicable only to persons directly
in charge of and responsible to the company and the latter having a
wider application though in a given situations. They might slightly
overlap. Equally the stringency of vicarious liability in the two sub-
sections is variable. When closely viewed, sub-section (2) is clearly
indictive of the fact that it is both a rule of evidence and yet again a
deeming    fiction or vicarious culpability. Perhaps the one crucial
aspect herein is the use of the word proved in the earlier part of the
sub-section. It comes into play only at the stage of the availability of
adequate proof that the offence has been committed with the consent,
connivance or neglect of the principal or other officers of the
company. The usual and the normal rule of criminal law is that the
charge must be brought home directly to the offender. However, sub-
section (2) lightens the burden by providing that even if it is proved
that the principal officers were guilty of consent, connivance or
negligence with regard to the offence committed by the company, they
would be within the net of culpability. This is effectuated by an
express deeming fiction that if any of the aforesaid ingredients is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                     41</span>

established then the officials concerned will be held guilty of that
offence and be punished accordingly. Sub-section (2) may truly come
into play during the course of the trial and even at its conclusion when
it is proved that the offence has been committed with the consent,
connivance or neglect of the company's principal officials. Thus, the
stringent rule in sub-section (2) in a way provides a second line of
defence for the prosecution. Even where the case set up is that the
offence has been directly, wilfully or deliberately committed by the
company and its officials but the same cannot be established to the
hilt, this sub-section provides that such officers would still be guilty if
the relatively lower culpability of even consent or mere connivance or
neglect is laid at his door. This is probably and patently due to the
difficulties of proving a charge beyond reasonable doubt in cases of
vicarious liability for offences committed by legal and artificial
persons as compared to natural persons. It bears repetition that this
sub-section (2) is a rule of evidence for apportioning guilty when
consent, connivance or neglect is proved by its principal officer and a
deeming fiction of guilt for vicarious liability to the crimes committed
by the company itself. Now once it is held as above, it is well settled
that a rule of evidence or a deeming fiction of the law are not to be
pleaded as such. No principle warrants that either in a complaint or in
a first information report the literal words of the statute must be
incorporated or what is even important is that the rule of evidence
with regard to burden of proof and a deeming fiction of guilt should
be quoted at the foundational stage. Therefore, to require that the
complaint or the first information report must inflexibly plead consent,
connivance or negligence of the officers at the threshold stage is,
patently fallacious. Seen broadly, the deeming fiction is primarily one
of evidence and proof and not of the literal formalities of pleading
which are foreign to the criminal law. Indeed, it must be notice that in
a particular case the prosecution charge may be one of direct,
deliberate and willful commission of the offence by the company and
its official. In such a situation to require that they should plead at the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                    42</span>

outset that it was only by way of connivance or neglect would be an
absurdity and, indeed, destructive or contrary to the case set up. Again,
as has been noticed above, sub-section (2) applies independently and
notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1). Therefore, to
require that the pleading of consent, connivance or neglect must be
incorporated even with regard to the guilt under sub-section (1), which
is absolute pertaining to the person in charge of and responsible to the
company, is in a way rather more fallacious. Thus, <a href="/doc/55287/" id="a_125">Section 47(2)</a> does
not mandate the incorporation that the offence was committed with the
consent or connivance or was attributable to the neglect on the part of
the Chairman, Director or General manager of the company in the
complaint itself.
</p>
<p id="p_79">         A bare reading of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_126">Section 47</a> makes it manifest that besides
persons who at the time the offence was committed were in charge and
were responsible to the Company for the conduct of the business of
the company, the Company as well is to be deemed to be guilty of the
offence and be liable to be proceeded against and punished
accordingly. The person conceived of in the section not only include
people who constitute the company but others as well. And in the
constitution of the Company, which word confinedly includes the
firm, all partners of the firm are seemingly guilty of the offences and
liable     to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. It
significantly does not hold them liable straightaway but starts with the
presumption in their being arraigned as accused. The safety valve is
provided in the proviso. Any of these persons can take shelter
thereunder to say that the offence was committed without his
knowledge or that he exercise all due diligence to prevent the
commission of the offence. Yet at any stage, on the contrary, if consent
or connivance or any neglect is attributed to any director, manager,
etc. then again the deeming provision comes into operation and they
can be held liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.
The section, as it appears is comprehensive enough to bring in a take
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                    43</span>

out people dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case. But
to say that being with no director of a company or partner of a firm
can be tried for the offence committed by the Company apparently
does not appeal. In all these conceived of under Secs 25 and 26 of the
said Act, requisite notices were sent to all concerned inclusive of the
petitioners to do the needful as required under the law. It is only on
the failure thereof that these complaints have been filed.

the Directors and Officers of the company can be prosecuted under
this section unless they prove that the offence was committed without

permitted to show that they did not have knowledge of the

<blockquote id="blockquote_52">        "5.    To appreciate the aforesaid contention, it becomes
        necessary to have a broader look on <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_130">Section 47</a> of the
        Act. It would seem undisputed that the Water (Prevention
        and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_131">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 is a recent
        beneficent legislation enacted in the larger interest of a
        cleaner ecology. This is plainly indicated by its very
        preamble which is in the following terms : --</blockquote>
<p id="p_81">        "<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_132">An Act</a> to provide for the prevention and control of
        water pollution and the maintaining or restoring of
        wholesomeness of water, for the establishment, with a
        view to carrying out the purposes aforesaid, of Boards
        for the prevention and control of water pollution, for
        conferring on and assigning to such Boards powers and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                            44</span>

functions relating thereto and for matters connected
therewith."
</p>
<p id="p_82">      Plainly enough, the prevention and absolute
control of water pollution and maintaining or restoring
of wholesomeness of the water resources of the country
cannot but be labelled as beneficent legislation which
has to be somewhat liberally construed. The violation of
the provisions of the Act, apart from the individual
persons, may also be committed by companies, bodies
corporate, firms and other associations of individuals.
<a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_133">Section 47</a> which we are called upon to construe
provides specifically for offences by companies which by
virtue of the Explanation was to extend to all the
aforementioned bodies. It is well settled that the strict
criminal liability of companies or legal persons is in a
class by itself and poses problems peculiar to them.
Since a legal person is a fiction of the law and does not
exist in actuality, the issue of vicarious liability of the
office-bearers   through    whom     a   company      must
necessarily act, comes to the fore. A plain reading of
<a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_134">Section 47</a> of the Act would indicate that this
incorporates the stringent principle of strict vicarious
criminal liability of persons who are responsible to the
company for the conduct of its business or its
responsible office bearers like a Director, Manager,
Secretary, etc., for all offences commuted by a company.
Now, strict vicarious criminal liability is somewhat of an
exception to the general rule of direct personal
culpability and is a modern development through
statutory provisions. That there can be such vicarious
criminal liability by legislative mandate is no longer in
dispute. Nevertheless steeped as we are in the basic
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                              45</span>

principle of criminal jurisprudence that mens rea must
be an ingredient of an offence and both the act and
intent must concur to constitute a crime, it needs some
effort to accept whole-heartedly the legislative mandate
of vicarious criminality even in the absence of either of
the aforesaid ingredients.
</p>
<p id="p_83">6.    The scheme of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_135">Section 47</a> calls for a somewhat
closer attention for its true construction. The word
'company' employed therein, as has already been
noticed, means any body corporate and includes a firm
or other associations of individuals, and Director in
relation to the firm means a partner of that firm. Sub-
section (1) creates a deeming legal fiction whereby every
person, who is in charge of and/or responsible to the
company for the conduct of its business becomes
automatically guilty of the offence committed by such a
company and is liable to be proceeded against and
punished accordingly. No other overt act or direct
commission of the offence by such a person is necessary
barring the factum of being in charge of the company or
responsible thereto for the conduct of its business. As
already noticed, this is so by virtue of the deeming
fiction under Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_136">Section 47</a> and one is
inclined to refer to the famous dictum of East End
Dwelling Co. Ltd. v. Finsbury Borough Council. (1952)
AC 109 at Pp. 132-133:--
</p>
<p id="p_84">"If you are bidden to treat an imaginary state of affairs
as real, you must surely, unless prohibited from doing so,
also imagine as real the consequences and incidents
which, if the putative state of affairs had in fact existed,
must inevitably have flowed from or accompanied it.
One of these in this case is emancipation from the 1939
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                            46</span>

level of rents. The statute says that you must imagine a
certain state of affairs; it does not say that having done
so, you must cause or permit your imagination to boggle
when it comes to the inevitable corollaries of that state
of affairs."
</p>
<p id="p_85">       The aforesaid rule stands approved and affirmed
by the Final Court in <a href="/doc/379047/" id="a_137">State of Bombay v. Pandurang
Vinayak</a>, AIR 1953 SC 244 and <a href="/doc/532707/" id="a_138">Boucher Pierre Andre v.
Superintendent, Central Jail</a>. Tihar. New Delhi, (1975) 1
SCC 192 : (AIR 1975 SC 164). <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_139">Section 47(1)</a>, therefore,
has two parts. The basic liability for the offence alleged
or established is against the company as such. Once the
allegation is levelled or established, then by a fiction of
the law every person in charge of and responsible to the
company for the conduct of its business is, in the eye of
law, deemed as much guilty of the offence as the primal
offending company.
</p>


<p id="p_86">7.     That the aforesaid rule is stringent and rigorous is
manifest. Yet this is sought to be tempered and a shade
softened by the proviso to Sub-section (1). This lays
down that such a person on whom vicarious liability has
been foisted may wriggle out of the same (if one may use
that word) if he proves that the offence was committed
without his knowledge or that he exercised all due
diligence to prevent the commission of the offence. The
burden of proof is clearly laid upon such a person and it
is thus plain that the proviso is a rule of evidence which
reverses the ordinary mandate of criminal liability that
the burden of establishing the offence lies on the
prosecution. Thus viewed, <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_140">Section 47(1)</a> and the proviso
thereto would lay down that once the offence is either
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                             47</span>

alleged or established against the company and the
added factum of being in charge of and responsible to
the company for the conduct of its business is existent
against a person, he becomes liable therefor, without
more, vicariously. The burden is then laid upon him to
establish and prove a total absence of knowledge about
the commission of the crime or a diligent prevention
thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_87">8.    Analysed as above, <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_141">Section 47(1)</a> spells out a
deeming fiction of vicarious liability and a rule of
evidence laying the burden of proof on persons in charge
of and responsible to the company for the conduct of its
business.
</p>
<p id="p_88">9.    Once it is held as above, the argument of the
learned counsel for the petitioner falls in its place and
stands conclusively repelled. It is settled beyond cavil
that rules of evidence and deeming fictions are not to be
expressly spelt out and pleaded. They are matters which
are for consideration and application in the course of
the trial. To require that the complaint itself must plead a
rule of evidence or, in terms, spell out a deeming fiction
provided by the statute therein is an argument bordering
on hyper technicality. One must always keep in mind the
broader perspective that the administration of criminal
law is more a matter of substance than of form and
should not be allowed to be obscured by pettifogging
technicality.
</p><p id="p_89">14.   ................The Managing Director of a company
from his very designation implies both the control and
command of the affairs of such a company and equally a
statutory liability to the company for responsible
conduct of its business. It is a compendious term, which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                              48</span>

signifies both control of and responsibility to the
company both in ordinary parlance and by virtue of the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_142">Indian Companies Act</a>. Consequently,
to insist that in spite of the description of a person as a
Managing Director of the Company, there must be a
further pleading that he is the person in charge thereof
and is responsible to it for the conduct of its business
would, to my mind, suffer from the vice of literality. Of
course, as the proviso to <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_143">Section 47(1)</a> shows, it is
permitted. even for a Managing Director to show that he
did not have any knowledge of the commission of the
offence or that he acted with the greatest diligence to
prevent the same. But the burden of proof is laid upon
him. The factum of being the Managing Director of the
company is by itself sufficient to attract the provisions of
<a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_144">Section 47(1)</a> and the vicarious liability specified
therein. The specific words therein he was in charge of
and was responsible to the company for the conduct of
the business of the company are not a magic incantation
which, unless respected, would vitiate a prosecution if
the substance of the matter is well spelt out either in the
complaint itself or in categoric terms by acceptable
testimony.
</p><p id="p_90">11.   The view aforesaid receives direct support from
<a href="/doc/1860679/" id="a_145">Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Ram Kishan Rohtagi</a>,
(AIR 1983 SC 67) (supra). Therein even with regard to
the lesser rank of officer like the Manager, their
Lordships observed as follows : --
</p>
<p id="p_91">"So far as the Manager is concerned, we are satisfied
that from the very nature of his duties it can be safely
inferred that he would undoubtedly be vicariously liable
for the offence; vicarious liability being an incident of
an offence under the Act."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                            49</span>

<p id="p_92">12.   ................To finally conclude on this aspect, on
the larger purpose of the Act and the particular
language of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_146">Section 47</a>(1} of the Act, as also on
principle and binding precedent, the answer to question
No. (i) posed at the outset is rendered in the negative. It
is held that <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_147">Section 47(1)</a> of the Act does not necessarily
mandate the incorporation of the words "was in charge
of and was responsible to the company for the conduct of
the business of the company" in all complaints against
the Chairman, the Managing Director or the General
Manager of the company for offences in contravention of
the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_93">13.   Adverting now to question No. (ii), it may perhaps
be noticed at the very outset that what has been held
above would broadly apply mutatis mutandis to Sub-
section (2) of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_148">Section 47</a> of the Act as well. Significantly
it begins with a non obstante clause and this, perhaps,
would have effect independently and notwithstanding
anything contained in the preceding Sub-section (1). In a
way it overrides the said provision and is somewhat
wider in its application. Unlike Sub-section (1) which
foists vicarious liability only on persons in charge of and
responsible to the company for the conduct of its
business, this sub-section imposes a somewhat similar
liability on a larger Class of Directors, managers,
Secretaries or even other officers of the company. In a
way this sub-section is envisaged to widen the net of
vicarious liability and to bring within its sweep not only
the primal officials of the company but even other
officers thereof if the commission of the offence by the
company can be established to have been done with the
consent, connivance or neglect-on their part. Thus, the
role and scope of Sub-section (2) is somewhat different
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                             50</span>

from that of Sub-section (1), the former being applicable
only to persons directly in charge of and responsible to
the company and the latter having a wider application
though in a given situation. They might slightly overlap.
Equally the stringency of vicarious liability in the two
sub-sections is variable.
</p>
<p id="p_94">14.   When closely viewed, Sub-section (2) is clearly
indicative of the fact that it is both a rule of evidence and
yet again a deeming fiction for vicarious culpability.
Perhaps the one crucial aspect herein is the use of the
word 'proved' in the earlier part of the sub-section. It
comes into play only at the stage of the availability of
adequate proof that the offence has been committed with
the consent, connivance or neglect of the principal or
other officers of the company. The usual and the normal
rule of criminal law is that the charge must be brought
home directly to the offender. However, Sub-section (2)
lightens the burden by providing that even if it is proved
that the principal officers were guilty of consent,
connivance or negligence with regard to the offence
committed by the company, they would be within the net
of culpability. This is effectuated by an express deeming
fiction that if any of the aforesaid ingredients is
established then the officials concerned will be held
guilty of that offence and be punished accordingly. Sub-
section (2) may truly come into play during the course of
the trial and even at its conclusion when it is proved that
the offence has been committed with the consent,
connivance or neglect of the company's principal
officials. Thus, the stringent rule in Sub-section (2) in a
way provides a second line of defence for the
prosecution. Even where the case set up is that the
offence has been directly, wilfully or deliberately
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                             51</span>

committed by the company and its officials but the same
cannot be established to the hilt, this sub-section
provides that such officer would still be guilty if the
relatively lower culpability of even consent or mere
connivance or neglect is laid at his door. This is
probably and patently due to the difficulties of proving a
charge beyond reasonable doubt in cases of vicarious
liability for offences committed by legal and artificial
persons as compared to natural persons. It bears
repetition that this Sub-section (2) is a rule of evidence
for apportioning guilt when consent, connivance or
neglect is proved by its principal officer and a deeming
fiction of guilt for vicarious Liability to the crimes
committed by the company itself.
</p>
<p id="p_95">15.   Now once it is held as above, it is well settled that
a rule of evidence or a deeming fiction of the law are not
to be pleaded as such. No principle warrants that either
in a complaint or in a first information report the literal

           consent or connivance or neglect would be an absurdity
           and indeed, destructive or contrary to the case set up.
           Again, as has been noticed above, Sub-section (2)

           rather more fallacious.

<p id="p_97">           Thus, in view of Principles of Stare decicis, the order dated
10.4.1987 has become final. It cannot be challenged by opposite parties
also. It was the duty of the trial court and revisional court to comply with
the directions of this Court and pass appropriate orders. From a bare
reading of impugned order dated 23.4.2005 and 15.5.2007, it transpires
that both the lower courts misconstrued the entire subject and passed the
order without adhering to the directions of this Court. In this regard, it is
relevant to mention that in compliance of the order dated 10.4.1987

the present case. Even the counsel who was conducting the
case earlier, did   not send any intimation about the
aforesaid proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_101">4.     That it is evident from <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_153">Section 47(1)</a> of Act no. 6 of
1974 which reveals that a person who at the time the
offence was committed was incharge, responsible to the
company for the conduct of the business of the company
would be held guilty for the offence.
</p>
<p id="p_102">5.     That vide order dated 10.4.1987 passed by Hon'ble
High Court at Allahabad in Criminal Misc. Case No. 10260
of 1986 the Hon'ble Court considered the aforesaid
averments raised in para-4 hereinabove and observed and
made it open to the company to inform the court about the
names of the persons or person who at time of occurrence
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                54</span>

was incharge and was responsible for the company and for
the conduct of the company. It was further directed that the
learned Magistrate should proceed against only those
persons who at the time of offence were incharge and
responsible to the company.
</p>
<p id="p_103">6.     That in pursuance and compliance of the order dated
10.4.1987 an application was moved on 28.1.1988 before
the learned Magistrate      stating the name of the person i.e.
Mr. A.B. Sen, son of R.B. Sen who was responsible for day to
day affairs of accused no. 1, this power was conferred upon
Mr. Sen vide resolution of the Board of the Directors of the
company dated 30.9.1985.
</p>
<p id="p_104">11.    That it is evident from the application dated
28.1.1988 and        resolution     dated   30.9.1985    which
clearly establishes that Mr. A.B. Sen was the person who
was appointed as an occupier of Ansal Paper and was
vested with the power of complete and direct control over
the affairs of the factory, and the applicants herein   were
neither incharge nor responsible for the company and for
the    conduct of the business of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_105">       Thereafter on 1.4.2005 the learned Magistrate
dismissed the application on following grounds:-
</p>
<p id="p_106">i.     The application was not signed by Shri A.P. Dwivedi
and the applicants/petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_107">ii.    Earlier on 16.7.1990, it was urged that Mr. R.C.
Rastogi, the then General Manager was responsible for the
day to day functioning of the company         while in        this
application Shri A.B. Sen has been mentioned as the person
responsible for handling the affairs of          the company.
Accordingly, the contents of both the applications      are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                       55</span>

      contrary to each other.
</p>
<p id="p_108">      iii.   The application under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_154">Section 245</a> (2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_155">Cr.P.C</a>. cannot
      be moved unless the evidence is adduced under <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_156">Section 244</a>
      Cr.P.C.
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">      iv.    <a href="/doc/1108335/" id="a_157">Section     305</a>    Cr.P.C.    cannot   be    taken   into
      consideration as a defence of the applicants.

      v.         The revisional court took the view that the
</pre><p id="p_109">      application was rightly rejected as the same was not signed
      by the person concerned and the impugned order was not a
      final order, accordingly the revisional jurisdiction was
      wrongly invoked by the applicants.
</p>
<p id="p_110">      vi.    The applicants were summoned and against
      summoning order the provision of revision are not attracted.
</p>
<p id="p_111">      vii.      Unless accused persons/applicants appear before the
      court concerned, they have no locus standi to further
      proceed in the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_112">      After going through the entire material available on record, it
appears that the learned Magistrate as well as learned Additional Sessions
Judge committed manifest error in rejecting the application and not
complying the direction given by this Court on 10.4.1987. Thus both the
orders are liable to be quashed for following reasons:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_53">       <a href="/doc/1809911/" id="a_158">Section 305(5)</a> Cr.P.C. postulates as under:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_54">             "Where a statement in writing purporting to be signed
      by the managing director of the corporation or by any
      person (by whatever name called) having or being one of the
      persons having the management of the affairs of the
      corporation to the effect that the person named in the
      statement has been appointed as the representative of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                    56</span>

      corporation for the purposes of this section, is filed, the
      Court shall, unless the contrary is proved, presume that such
      person has been so appointed.</blockquote>

<p id="p_113">      Thus, in view of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_159">Section 305</a> (5) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_160">Cr.P.C</a>. the court has to raise
presumption under <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_161">Section 114</a> of Indian Evidence Act about the
statement made by the company and there was no material before the
court below to presume otherwise. There was no objection from the side
of opposite parties about the allegations made in the application..
Moreover, it is clear from the averments made under <a href="/doc/1809911/" id="a_162">Section 305(5)</a>
Cr.P.C. that A.B. Sen was appointed as incharge of the company, he was
responsible for day to day functioning of the company i.e. accused no. 1.
The Board of Directors made a resolution to this effect on 30.9.1985.
Thus, there was hardly any occasion for the learned Magistrate to
disbelieve the version of the Board of Directors and company on the point
of complicity of A.B. Sen. There was noting on record contrary to it.
Thus a presumption under <a href="/doc/1809911/" id="a_163">Section 305(5)</a> Cr.P.C. read with <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_164">Section 114</a>
of Indian Evidence Act may be           raised about the genuineness of
resolution of Board of Directors of Company dated 30.9.1985.          No
credible evidence was available on record to discredit the same and the
resolution at this stage can not be said to be false and fabricated
document.
</p>
<p id="p_114">      It is further pertinent to mention that A.B. Sen was remained
working in the Company through out and was present even at the time of
taking the sample of the effluent. The company brought it to the notice of
the learned Magistrate in the application dated 28.1.1988 that A.B. Sen
was appointed as a sole occupier of Ansal Papers Ltd. and he was vested
with the power and control over the affairs of the company. This Court
on 10.04.1987 directed the Magistrate that after considering the said
application he shall proceed with the case against those persons who at
the time of offence were incharge and responsible for the day to day
functioning and for the conduct of the company as mentioned under
<a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_165">Section 47</a> of the Act. Accordingly there was hardly any scope before
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                     57</span>

the learned Magistrate not to consider the version of the company on the
point of complicity of A.B. Sen and to flout the direction given by this
Court. The Magistrate was required to dispose of the application dated
28.1.1988, 16.7.1990 and 9.3.2005. Accordingly simply on the ground
that company earlier mentioned that R.C. Rastogi was also responsible
for the affairs of the company, it was not possible to hold that A.B. Sen
was also not responsible for the affairs of the company. Consequently on
this ground alone, the order is liable to be quashed. A.B. Sen is
responsible for the day to day affairs of the company, accordingly his
complicity at the stage of furnishing information cannot be doubted in
view of <a href="/doc/1809911/" id="a_166">Section 305(5)</a> Cr.P.C. and the Magistrate ought to have
proceeded against him as well as against R.C.Rastogi as many persons
can be responsible for day today affairs of the Company.
</p>
<p id="p_115">      It further transpires that the learned Magistrate took a hyper
technical view in the matter that the application at the stage of <a href="/doc/1521732/" id="a_167">Section
245(2)</a> Cr.P.C. was not tenable. <a href="/doc/1521732/" id="a_168">Section 245(2)</a> Cr.P.C. reproduced as
under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_55">             "Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to prevent a
      Magistrate from discharging the accused at any previous
      stage of the case if, for reasons to be recorded by such
      Magistrate, he considers the charge to be groundless."</blockquote>

<p id="p_116">      It transpires that at any stage the application for discharge can be
moved. The application was moved under the direction of this Court,
consequently on this ground, it cannot be rejected that after recording the
evidence under <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_169">Section 244</a> Cr.P.C., the same would be considered and it
was premature to pass any order. Thus on this count only, the order of the
Magistrate is not sustainable in the eyes of law. The Magistrate is
required to pass appropriate order about the complicity of the applicants
keeping the provision of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_170">Section 47</a> of the Act in mind. It makes no
difference whether the Magistrate is of the view that along with Shri A.B.
Sen Shri R.C. Rastogi is also responsible for the conduct of the company,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                     58</span>

the case can proceed against R.C. Rastogi also, but to hold A.B. Sen not
guilty is a blatant error in the eyes of law and Magistrate ought not to
have taken into consideration the averment that since R.C. Rastogi was
earlier involved in the affairs of the company, accordingly the case
against A.B. Sen could not proceed on the assertion of the company
appears to be totally contrary in the light of the presumption to be raised
in the light of <a href="/doc/1809911/" id="a_171">Section 305(5)</a> Cr.P.C as there was no request from the side
of the applicants that R.C. Rastogi should be discharged. The learned
Magistrate ought to have proceeded against R.C. Rastogi as well as Shri
A.B. Sen, but to refuse to proceed against A.B. Sen appears to be an
abuse of process of law specially when without any material the
resolution of the company on the point of complicity of Shri A.B. Sen
was not taken into consideration by the learned Magistrate. The learned
Magistrate should not have missed the facts taken into consideration that
the Managers are also responsible under <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_172">Section 47</a> of the Act. Thus
R.C.Rastogi and A.B.Sen both can be responsible for running day today
functioning of the Company and may be prosecuted under law by
applying <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_173">Section 47</a> of the Act. The view of learned Magistrate that the
contents of both the applications are contradictory is not sustainable for
the reasons that total information can be furnished on behalf of the
Company in many parts. Thus the complicity of each and every person
has to be seen during the trial and on this count R.C.Rastogi and A.B.Sen
cannot be exonerated disbelieving the version of the Company about their
complicity in the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_117">      I have also mentioned the scope of <a href="/doc/249603/" id="a_174">Section 47</a> Cr.P.C. and in view
of the Full Bench decision of Patna High Court in the case of Mahmud
Ali Vs. State of Bihar and another, AIR 1986 Pat. 133 (Supra),
involvement of A.B. Sen and R.C.Rastogi in this case constituting the
offence has to be construed. Accordingly, the learned trial court should
have proceeded against both of them even prior to the recording of
evidence under <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_175">Section 244</a> Cr.P.C.         The application was wrongly
rejected on the ground that the same was not signed by the applicants. It
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                    59</span>

transpires that vide order dated 10.4.1987 this Court directed that the
applicants may appear before the learned Magistrate through counsel.
Consequently, the application could have been moved by the Advocate.
There is no legal bar to move the application under <a href="/doc/1809911/" id="a_176">Section 305(5)</a> Cr.P.C.
read with <a href="/doc/1521732/" id="a_177">Section 245(2)</a> Cr.P.C. by any Advocate.       There was hardly
any occasion for the court below to refuse to proceed against Shri A.B.
Sen, only on the ground that the application was not signed by the
applicants, on the contrary this Court permitted counsel to move
application on behalf of applicants, accordingly the application was
rightly moved. Thus, on this count, the application was wrongly rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_118">      It is further pertinent to refer that in the impugned order, the
Magistrate observed that accused were summoned and accordingly unless
they appear before the Magistrate, the application cannot be moved is
also in contravention of the order of this Court, wherein the directions
were given to the Magistrate to pass appropriate order in accordance with
law fixing the responsibility of the persons or person who at the time of
occurrence was incharge and was responsible for the company and for the
conduct of the company. In view of the direction of this Court, the
application ought not have been rejected on the ground that the applicants
were not present before the court. Moreover, the learned Magistrate
committed error in law by ignoring the earlier order of exemption passed
by the Chief Judicial Magistrate on 14.6.1988. The order dated 14.6.1988
is quoted herein below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_56">             "Case called out, accused Sushil, Gopal, Deepak
      Ansal, C.L. Anand, C.L. Laxman, T.R. Tuli and V.S.
      Agarwal are exempted till further order. R.L. Bhargava and
      O.P. Sharma are absent. Pairokar of the accused is present,
      fixed 29.7.1988."</blockquote>

<p id="p_119">      Thus, in view of the aforesaid circumstances, once the exemption
was granted by the Magistrate, it was not possible that subsequently the
order should have been passed insisting that at the time of moving the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                      60</span>

application, the applicants should be present in the Court contrary to the
direction of this Court. Further it appears that the learned revisional court
also committed the error in affirming the view of the Magistrate. The
view taken by the Sessions Court that the order was not final in nature
appears to be in correct as referred to above in view of the provisions of
principles of stare decicis coupled with the direction of this Court. The
finality has to be attached with the order dated 10.4.1987 passed by this
Court and this Court is duty bound to ensure the compliance of the earlier
order passed by it. The revision was wrongly dismissed simply on the
ground that no finality can be attached is an erroneous proposition of law.
It may further be mentioned that <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_178">Section 245(2)</a> is an independent
provision while <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_179">Section 245(1)</a> is general provision. <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_180">Section 244</a> Cr.P.C.
speaks about recording of evidence, accordingly in view of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_181">Section 245</a>
(2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_182">Cr.P.C</a>., the application can be moved for discharge at any stage and
there was no occasion to doubt the correctness of the order passed by this
Court instead of raising the technical objections in its implementation.
Thus, the view of the learned Magistrate on 23.4.2005 and learned
Additional Sessions Judge dated 15.5.2007 dismissing the revision appear
to be not in accordance with law. Thus, to prevent the abuse of process of
law and also to secure the ends of justice and ensure the compliance of
the order dated 10.4.1987, which is a final order, it is incumbent upon the
Court to quash the order dated 23.4.2005 and 15.5.2007 by exercising the
power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_183">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_120">      To avoid the technicalities in the matter it may further be necessary
to observe that in view of order dated 10.4.1987, responsibility for the
conduct of the affairs of the company comes within the ambit of <a href="/doc/249603/" id="a_184">Section
47</a> Cr.P.C. and responsible persons can be prosecuted. The Magistrate
has to pass appropriate order on the application of the applicants fixing
their liability. If they are not liable then they may be discharged at the
stage of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_185">Section 245</a> (2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_186">Cr.P.C</a>. even without recording the statement
under <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_187">Section 244</a> Cr.P.C. Further it will be open before the trial court to
proceed against the applicants also in case, if their liability is fixed in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                       61</span>

view of provisions of <a href="/doc/249603/" id="a_188">section 47</a> Cr.P.C., but under           no event the
Magistrate can refuse to proceed against A.B. Sen also contrary to
resolution of the company simply because of the fact that in the
application dated 16.7.1990 reference of R.C. Rastogi, the then General
Manager was made.         The Magistrate can also proceed against R.C.
Rastogi as the circumstances do warrant to proceed against him. It may
further be necessary to point out that it is not mandatory that the Advocate
should have moved the application after obtaining the signature of Shri
A.B. Diwedi as it was directed by this Court that the application should
be moved before the court below through counsel.. The lawyer alone has
to move application on behalf of the applicants for discharge.
Accordingly, the averment made in the application dated 9.3.2005 is not
defective and there is no necessity to issue any direction to the applicants
to move any application afresh. However, in case any clarification is
required, the Magistrate may obtain information for the disposal of the
application from the applicants through counsel without recalling the
order dated 14.6.1988, which is in consonance of the order passed by this
Court.      Thus the order dated 14.6.1988 is still in force granting
exemption, is not liable to be recalled by the court below and thus without
insisting the personal appearance of the applicants as per order passed by
this Court, the application has to be decided.
</p>
<p id="p_121">         Further at this stage, it may be clarified that observations made in
the judgment are only to the extent to the disposal of the petition under
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_189">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. and this Court has not entered into the merits of the
present case. The trial court without being influenced by any of the
observations made in the judgment, shall exercise its unfettered discretion
on the basis of the record and proceed in accordance with law and pass
appropriate orders in accordance with the direction dated 10.4.1987 of
this Court on the application of the applicants for their discharge fixing
the liability of the persons under <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_190">Section 47</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_122">         Thus, the impugned orders dated 23.4.2005 passed by the Special
Judicial Magistrate and order dated 15.5.2007 passed by the Additional
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                     62</span>

Sessions Judge in criminal case no. 126 of 2005 are not tenable in the
eyes of law and are liable to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_123">      On behalf of the applicants it has been urged that the order
dated 1.4.2005 issuing process u/s 82 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_191">Cr.P.C</a>. is liable to be quashed as
the Magistrate has overlooked the provisions of law and proceeded in
an arbitrary manner.
</p><p id="p_124">      Learned counsel for the applicants has pointed out that in the
application at para-11 it was mentioned that after the dismissal of the
revision application, proceedings before Special Magistrate were
resumed and the learned Magistrate issued summons by order dated
1.10.2004 fixing 27.10.2004. On 27.10.2004 the summons was not
received/served upon the applicants and without considering this
aspect of the service the learned Magistrate proceeded to issue Non-
Bailable warrants on the same day which was wholly arbitrary, illegal
and unjustified. The attention of this Court was also drawn to the fact
that earlier on 14.6.1988 the learned Magistrate exempted the
appearance of the applicants till further orders. The order dated
14.06.1988 was not recalled. It was still operative. It was not possible
for the Magistrate to issue notice and Non Bailable Warrant against the
applicants. It is apparent that facts of paras 11 and 12 of the petition
have not been disputed in the counter affidavit. It further transpires
that on 1.4.2005 the case was called out. On behalf of the company Sri
A.P.Dwivedi was present. Rest of the accused were absent. An
application on behalf of the accused was moved on the ground of
illness of Sri Satyendra Singh Advocate through his Junior. The
Magistrate without assigning any reason and rejecting the application
for adjournment issued Non Bailable Warrant against the petitioners
and decided to proceed against the applicants under the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1598801/" id="a_192">Section 82</a> Cr.P.C. It transpires from the order sheet that the Non
Bailable Warrants earlier issued were not executed and the report of
the executing officer was not available on record. Accordingly process
u/s 82 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_193">Cr.P.C</a>. under the law could not be issued and the Magistrate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                    63</span>

committed error in law, especially ignoring the fact that earlier order
dated 14.6.1988 of exemption was not recalled or vacated.
</p><p id="p_125">      Thus in view of un-controverted facts it transpires that even
after exemption granted to the applicants the Magistrate further issued
summons on 01.10.2004 fixing 27.10.2004. On 27.10.2004 the
summons were not received/served upon the applicants.
</p><p id="p_126">      In this context provisions as contained in Chapter VI-A of the
Code of Criminal Procedure reveal that how the process to compel the
appearance has to be issued. The process to compel the appearance is
dealt with here;
</p>         (1) Summons u/s 61 Cr.P.C.
<p id="p_127">         (2) Warrant u/s 70
      If through summons the Court has failed to secure attendance, it
is open to the Court or Magistrate to issue a warrant after recording
the reasons in writing u/s 87 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_194">Cr.P.C</a>. In cases where a warrant fails to
take effect the procedure of proclamation as absconder u/s 82 is to be
taken and if the absconder is not forthcoming, his property is attached
and sold u/s 83/85 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_195">Cr.P.C</a>. One more method of securing attendance is
the taking of bond with or without sureties u/s 88.
</p><p id="p_128">      It is not disputed that u/s 61 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_196">Cr.P.C</a>. the summons were issued.
The summons were not served u/s 62 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_197">Cr.P.C</a>. They were also not
received after service on applicants. Consequently in this case the
summons were not served. Thus in this case there is no service of
summons under law. The Magistrate in case was of the view that
personal service as provided u/s 62 cannot be effected the law allows
service on some adult member of the family. There is no material to
show that the persons summoned against was not found by exercise of
due diligence and the summons were served on any of the family
members in view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/835275/" id="a_198">Section 64</a> Cr.P.C. Thus instead
of proceeding u/s 64 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_199">Cr.P.C</a>. that too was not possible at the first stage
the Magistrate ought not to have issued warrants u/s 70 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_200">Cr.P.C</a>. on
27.10.2004. It further transpires that even the warrants was not served
and the process u/s 82 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_201">Cr.P.C</a>. was issued on 1.4.2005. The Magistrate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                    64</span>

has also not rejected the application for adjournment of the counsel.
The application was moved on the ground of illness. Further it appears
that the order dated 1.4.2005 suffers from illegality that the Magistrate
has not referred the reason for his satisfaction to issue process u/s 82
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_202">Cr.P.C</a>.
</p><p id="p_129">      In view of the circumstances referred to above it transpires that
the Magistrate has neither adopted the procedure in accordance with
law in issuing the warrants against the applicants but also committed
error in law by issuing orders u/s 82 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_203">Cr.P.C</a>. ignoring the provisions
referred to above. In this context the view taken by this Court in 1994
CriLJ 1783, Devendra Singh Negi alias Debu Versus State of U.P. and
another, is crystal clear. Para-14 is relevant which reads as under;
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">             "The words, "has absconded or is concealing
      himself so that such warrant cannot be executed" in
      <a href="/doc/1598801/" id="a_204">Section 82</a> of the Code are significant. Every person who
      is not immediately available cannot be characterised as
      an absconder. The Court has to record its satisfaction that
      the accused has absconded or is concealing in order to
      avoid execution of the warrant. The provisions of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_205">Section
      82</a> are mandatory and are to be construed strictly. <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_206">Section
      82</a> requires that the court must, in the first instance, issue
      a warrant and it must put down its reasons for behaving
      that the accused is absconding or concealing himself. My
      view expressed above is supported by a Division Bench
      case of <a href="/doc/1850541/" id="a_207">Dip Narain Singh V.State of Bihar</a>, 1981 Cri LJ
      1672 (Patna). Thus, in every case       where the warrant
      is not executed, resort cannot be had to <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_208">Section 82</a> and it
      may be necessary to examine the officer concerned who
      had gone to execute the warrant and to the measures
      adopted by him to serve the same."</blockquote>
<p id="p_130">      It further transpires that 2007 Cri.LJ 3113, Abdul Rahman
and another Vs. State of Rajasthan, further deals with a problem
wherein Rajasthan High Court took a view that before declaring the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                     65</span>

accused as absconder the Court has to be satisfied that accused had left
his permanent residence or he is avoiding service or there is no chance
of arrest in near future. Para-6 of the same is quoted below;
</p><p id="p_131">      "It is settled proposition of law that before declaring the accused
as absconder, the Court has to be satisfied that accused had left their
permanent residence or they are avoiding service or there is no chance
of arrest in near future."
</p><p id="p_132">      After going through the record it transpires that without service
of summons the Non Bailable Warrants were issued and without
recording the satisfaction the process u/s 82 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_209">Cr.P.C</a>. were issued. Thus
the procedure as adopted by the Magistrate is not in accordance with
the procedure provided in <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_210">Cr.P.C</a>.
</p><p id="p_133">      Thus on the face of it the impugned orders of issuing Non
Bailable warrants against the applicants on 27.10.2004 and the order
dated 1.4.2005 were not passed in accordance with law, therefore,
they are liable to be quashed. It further transpires that the Magistrate
should have disposed of the application for adjournment moved by the
counsel on the ground of illness, rather he should have accommodated
him. No order ought to have been passed on the application in absence
of the counsel. This practice is not correct. The application ought to
have been decided.
</p><p id="p_134">      Since the order dated 1.4.2005 is erroneous accordingly I do not
consider it appropriate to direct the Magistrate to pass any order on the
application for adjournment as the matter is already over. Accordingly
the orders dated 27.10.2004 and 1.4.2005 are hereby quashed.
</p><p id="p_135">      The learned Magistrate shall take into consideration this fact
that earlier on 14.06.1988 the court exempted the attendance of the
applicants. The order is still operative and it has not been vacated, as
such in view of directions of this Court dated 10.4.1987 the applicants
may appear before the learned Magistrate through counsel,
accordingly the orders dated 23.4.2005 and 15.5.2007, passed by the
Special Judicial Magistrate Pollution, Lucknow, annexures 10 and 11
are hereby quashed. Further the orders dated 27.10.2004 and 1.4.2005
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">                                 66</span>

are also quashed. The prayers for quashing the proceedings in
Criminal Case No.13 and 14 of 1993, pending in the court of Special
Judicial Magistrate (Pollution), Lucknow are refused. However it is
provided that the Magistrate shall proceed in accordance with the
directions given by this Court on 10.04.1987 and further decide the
application fixing the liability of applicants who at the time of
occurrence were incharge and responsible for the conduct of the
company u/s 47 of the Act or not and dispose of the pending
applications dated 28.1.1988,16.7.1990 and 09.03.2005 in accordance
with law. The applicants shall be allowed to appear through counsel
before the court concerned in view of the observations and reasons
referred to above.
