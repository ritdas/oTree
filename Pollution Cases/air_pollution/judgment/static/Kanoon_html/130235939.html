<pre id="pre_1">  THE HON'BLE THE ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE RAMESH RANGANATHAN</pre>
<p id="p_1">                               AND
                       THE HON'BLE Ms. JUSTICE J. UMA DEVI


                     WRIT PETITION NO.16078 OF 2018

ORDER:   (per Hon'ble the Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan)



      A peculiar relief is sought in this Writ Petition.                        The

petitioner seeks a mandamus to permit them to withdraw Appeal

No.23 of 2016 pending on the file of the Appellate Authority under

the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. The petitioner

herein filed an appeal, before the Appellate Authority, under the

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, in Appeal No.23 of

2016 against the order of closure passed by the Telangana State

Pollution Control Board. An interim order was granted staying the

order of closure passed by the Pollution Control Board for a period

of two months.        This order, according to Sri K. Venumadhav,

Learned Counsel for the petitioner, was extended thereafter.


</p><p id="p_2">      The term of office of the earlier Chairman and members of

the Appellate Authority expired, and the State Government is said

not to have filled up the vacant posts thereafter. As on today the

Appellate Authority is not functioning as the State Government has

not appointed its Chairman or the members.                           The petitioner,

therefore, seeks permission of this Court to withdraw Appeal No.23

of 2016 filed by them before the Appellate Authority.


</p><p id="p_3">      The grievance of the petitioner, as put forth by Sri K.

Venumadhav, Learned Counsel for the petitioner, is that, since the

State Government has not appointed the Appellate Authority, they
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>




are in no position to withdraw the appeal preferred by them before

the authority; and, consequently, they are forced to invoke the

jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of

India.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">         The effect of granting the relief, sought for by the petitioner

in this Writ Petition, is that the order of closure, passed by the

Telangana State Pollution Control Board, would revive and

continue to remain in force. Sri P. Shiva Kumar, Learned Standing

Counsel for the Telangana State Pollution Control Board, would

submit that the Pollution Control Board has no objection for the

appeal, preferred by the petitioner before the Appellate Authority,

being permitted to be withdrawn as it would only result in revival

of the order of closure passed by the Telangana State Pollution

Control Board earlier.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">         As Sri P. Shiva Kumar, Learned Standing Counsel for the

Telangana State Pollution Control Board, expresses no objection

for the relief, sought for in the Writ Petition, being granted; and as

the Appellate Authority is not functioning, we consider it

appropriate to exercise our extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article

226</a> of the Constitution of India, and permit the petitioner herein to

withdraw Appeal No.23 of 2016 filed by them before the Appellate

Authority under the Air and Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>s.     Suffice it to make it clear that the effect of

withdrawal of the appeal would result in revival of the order of

closure passed by the Telangana State Pollution Control Board.

Let a copy of this order be communicated to the Registrar, in the

office of the Appellate Authority, for their information.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       3</span>




</p><p id="p_8">         The   Writ   Petition   is   disposed   of   accordingly.   The

miscellaneous petitions pending, if any, shall stand closed.          No

costs.
