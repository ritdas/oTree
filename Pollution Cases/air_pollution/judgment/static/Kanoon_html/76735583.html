      THIS CRIMINAL PETITION COMING ON FOR ADMISSION, THIS
DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                           ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Heard learned counsel for petitioner. Learned counsel for

respondents is absent. Perused the records.


</p><p id="p_2">      2.   Substance of accusations against the petitioner and

other accused is that without requisite consent, petitioners

herein carried on mining activities and extracted 79,853 tones of

Iron Ore, 3771 tons of clay during the period 2004-2005 and

21,444 tons of Iron Ore, 4,816 tons of Clay and 1760 tons of

Manganese Ore during the period 2005-2006 without obtaining

CFE/CFO from the Board in violation of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_1">Section 21</a>/<a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_2">22</a>        of Air

(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, (hereinafter

referred to as 'Act' for short), which attracts penal action under

<a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_4">Section 37</a> of the Act.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                       3</span><p id="p_3">




</p><p id="p_4">      3.      Learned counsel for petitioner has assailed the

impugned action on the following grounds:

</p><p id="p_5">       First, there was no proper authorization for prosecution of

the petitioner. Referring to the resolution dated 27.09.2006

passed by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board,             learned

counsel    for        petitioner   submitted   that    under   the      said

resolution/memo, Board had authorized only the Chairman, but

the   Chairman,         has   sub-delegated    the    authority,   to   the

Environmental Officer, contrary to the initial authorization and

therefore on this ground alone the impugned proceedings are

liable to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      Second, the assignment of mining lease had taken place

in 2004-2005. As on that day, petitioner was not the owner of

the Mine and therefore, the prosecution of the petitioner for the

alleged violation is illegal and untenable.

</p><p id="p_7">      4. Both these contentions, in my view, are misconceived

and cannot be accepted. Insofar as the authorisation to initiate

prosecution      is    concerned,    the   memo   dated    27.9.2006      at

Annexure-H reads as under:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                          4</span><p id="p_8">

       M/s.Teja Works, ML No.2353, Sy.No.37,
Sondenahalli Village, C.N.Halli Taluk, Tumkur
District, is engaged in mining of Iron Ore without
obtaining CFE from the Board. The Board has also
refused the consent for operation on 8.5.2006. It is
reported by the Regional Officer in the letter cited
under reference that, the mine has produced 79,853
Tons of Iron Ore and 3771 tones of clay for the
period 2004-2005 and 21,444 Tons of Iron Ore,
4,816 Towns of Clay and 1760 Tons of Manganese

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  5</span>




      knowledge of the violations committed by M/s.Teja
      Works, ML No.2353, Sy.No.37, Sondenahalli Village,
      C.N.Halli Taluk, Tumkur District, hereby authorize
      the Environmental Officer, Regional Office, KSPCB,
      Tumkur, to file a Criminal Case for violation under
      <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_16">Section 21</a>/<a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_17">22</a> read with <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_18">Section 37</a> of Air
      (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_19">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981, against
      M/s.Teja    Works,     ML     No.2353,     Sy.No.37,
      Sondenahalli Village, C.N.Halli Taluk, Tumkur
      District.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">      5. A reading of the said memo indicates that by the said

memo, Dr. H.C. Sharatchandra, Chairman, Karnataka State

Pollution Control Board, authorized the Environmental Officer to

file a criminal case for the alleged violation. Private complaint is

filed by the Regional Officer viz., the Environmental Officer in

terms of the above authorization. Therefore, there is absolutely

no illegality in the initiation of criminal action as contended by

the learned counsel for the petitioner.


</p><p id="p_15">      6.   In the case relied on by the learned counsel for the

petitioner in P Parimala and Others Vs .State of Karnataka

and another, AIR 2015 SC 2495, the Regional Officer was

authorized by the delegate (Chairman of the Board), since the

delegate (Chairman of the Board) had sub-delegated authority
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  6</span>




and in that circumstance, it was held that presentation of the

complaint was without proper authorization. In the instant case,

the complaint having been filed in terms of the authorization

issued by the Chairman of the Karnataka State Pollution Control

Board, there is no illegality in the initiation of the proceedings as

sought to be made out by the learned counsel for the petitioner.


</p><p id="p_16">       7.   Coming to the other contention urged by the learned

counsel for the petitioner, the same is a question of fact, which

cannot be decided under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_20">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. nor could it be

considered as a ground to quash the proceedings. As a result, I

do not find any merit in the contentions urged by the learned

counsel for the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_17">       Consequently, the petition is dismissed.
