		For Petitioner      	 	: Mr.P.Vijendran

		For Respondents		: Mr.G.Vasudevan 
O R D E R
</pre>
	
<p id="p_1">	The petitioner is running Garment business, at Door No.23, Ranganathan Street, T.Nagar, Chennai-61.  Electricity Service Connection No.181-32-18, has been disconnected due to non-payment of Current Consumption Charges.  He has filed this present writ petition, for a Mandamus, directing the Assistant Engineer, Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, T.Nagar, Chennai-17, 2nd respondent herein, to assess the correct electricity consumption charges, to the service connection, for the period from 20.03.2013 to May 2013, as contemplated in Rule 11(2) of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Supply Code, 2004.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2.	According to the petitioner, he is regular in payment of Current Consumption Charges.  That on 19.03.2013, while calculating the same, an employee of the respondents-Board, informed the petitioner that the electric meter defective.  Therefore, he made a representation on 20.03.2013 to the 2nd respondent, to change the electric meter.  Accordingly, a new meter was fixed on 06.06.2013.  While that be so, on 20.07.2013, some other employee of the Electricity Board informed the petitioner that he has to pay Rs.1,67,794/-, as Current Consumption Charges, for the period from January' 2012 to May' 2013.  According to him, the respondents have taken the average Current Consumption Charges at Rs.3,420/- and arbitrarily, assessed the same, for the abovesaid period, totalling Rs.1,67,794/-.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3.	Referring to the meter reading from September' 2011 to March' 2013, Current Consumption Charges entered in the meter card, issued by the Electricity Board, Mr.P.Vijendran, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that even after the employee of the Electricity Board, noticing the defect on 19.03.2013, whatever be the Current Consumption Charges recorded in the meter card, the same has been duly and promptly paid by the petitioner and that therefore, the calculation made by the Board, determining a huge sum of Rs.1,67,794/-, as current consumption charges, for the period between January' 2012 to May' 2013, is illegal.
</p>	
<p id="p_4">	4.	Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that as per Regulation 11(2) of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Supply Code, 2004,  2003, the quantity of electricity supplied during the period in question shall be determined by taking the average of the electricity supplied during the preceding four months, in respect of both High Tension service connections and Low Tension service connections provided that the conditions in regard to use of electricity during the said four months were not different from those which prevailed during the period in question.  
</p>
<p id="p_5">	5.	According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the respondents have not properly calculated the Current Consumption Charges.  He submitted that no sooner, the employee had noticed the electric meter was defective, the petitioner submitted a letter, dated 20.03.2013 to the respondents, for changing the meter, but the meter was changed only on 06.06.2013.  
</p>	
<p id="p_6">	6.	Referring to the representation, dated 25.07.2013 and the reminder, dated 06.08.2013, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that as per his calculation, the average Current Consumption Charges, for the period between 25.11.2012 to 24.05.2013, is higher than the sum, that ought to have been arrived at, and that, the respondents have erred in calculating the average Current Consumption Charges.  Referring to <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_2">Section 56</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003, he submitted that 15 days' notice in writing had not been given before disconnecting the supply and that therefore, there is a violation of principles of natural justice.   
</p>
<p id="p_7">	7.	On the objection regarding maintainability of the writ petition that for the dispute now raised, regarding calculation of the Current Consumption Charges and that there is a separate forum, viz., Consumer Grievances Redressal Forum, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that, as per Regulation No.6 of the Regulations for Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum and Electricity Ombudsman, 2004, the Electricity Board ought to have notified the details of the address of the forum in the Media and the licencee, viz., Electricity Board ought to have made the copies of the procedure available to the consumers for lodging complaints. According to the learned counsel, the procedure contemplated in Regulation 6 of the abovesaid Regulation, has not been done and therefore, it is not open to the respondents to object to the maintainability of the writ petition, wherein, judicial review has been sought for.
</p>
<p id="p_8">	8.	Placing reliance on a decision of the Apex Court in 1980 (4) SCC 531, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that when judicial review of the action of the respondents is sought for, and when  electricity supply is a necessity, disconnection of which, has affected the petitioner's right to trade and business under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_3">Article 19(g)</a> of the Constitution of India and therefore, prayed to overrule the objections, regarding maintainability.
</p>
<p id="p_9">	9.	Per contra, based on the counter affidavit, filed by the Assistant Executive Engineer, O &amp; M, Usman Road, CEDC Centra, TANGEDCO, T.N.E.B., Ltd., T.Nagar, Chennai-17, Mr.G.Vasudevan, learned counsel appearing for the Electricity Board made a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petition, contending inter-alia that if the petitioner was aggrieved over the Current Consumption Charges determined by the Board, he should have filed a complaint  before the Consumer Grievances Redressal Forum, constituted under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_4">Section 42</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003.  He further submitted that the Forum is presided over by a Chairperson, in the rank of a Superintending Engineer and two members.  He therefore submitted that the writ petition has to be dismissed in limini on the abovesaid ground of not availing an alternative and comprehensive remedy, before the said authority.
</p>
<p id="p_10">	10.	Without prejudice to the above, on merits, learned counsel appearing for the Electricity Board submitted that the petitioner has made a representation on 26.03.2013, for changing the meter on the ground that it was not functioning and accordingly, the meter was replaced on 05.06.2013.  He further submitted that it could be evident from the reading recorded in the meter card and entered in data base of TANGEDCO that revision of past bills pertaining to the defective period from March 2012 to May 2013 was necessitated.  He further submitted that the revision of assessment has been done, in terms of Regulation 11 of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Supply Code, 2004, which provides the manner of Assessment of billing, in cases, where there is no meter or meter is defective.  
</p><p id="p_11">	11.	Taking this Court through the comparative consumption reading recorded, as extracted in Paragraph 6 of the counter affidavit, learned counsel appearing for the Electricity Board submitted that from the perusal of meter reading from September 2011, it is evident that the meter was not running properly from the month of March 2012 and until 05.06.2013, it was replaced.  By referring to the Tabular Column, at Paragraph 7 of the counter affidavit, he submitted that as per Regulation 11(5) of the Supply Code, 2004,  revision of assessment for the period, when the meter was defective, has been assessed properly and that there is no illegality or irregularity.
</p>	
<p id="p_12">	12.	Learned Counsel appearing for the Electricity Board contended that the manner of assessment suggested by the petitioner, is untenable, for the reason that, the petitioner is seeking to assess the average for the defective period, taking into account the defective reading, instead of the reading recorded, in normal circumstances. 
</p>
<p id="p_13">	13.	Referring to a decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/172527/" id="a_5">Maharastra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd., v. Lloyds Steel Industries Ltd</a>., reported in AIR 2008 SC 1042, learned counsel appearing for the Electricity Board submitted that when a Forum has been created, the consumers can only resort to the said Forum, for redressal of their grievances and a writ petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, is not maintainable.  
</p>
<p id="p_14">	14.	After the completion of the arguments, on the side of the respondents, though it was pointed out that as per <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_7">Section 42(5)</a> of the Electricity Act, a Consumer Grievances Redressal Forum has been constituted with the Superintending Engineer, Electricity Board, heading the forum, with two other members, and when the learned counsel for the petitioner was given a option to approach the said Forum, he insisted that the matter be decided under judicial review.  Submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is placed on record.  In the abovesaid circumstances, this Court is proposed to consider the rival submissions of the learned counsel  for either side.
</p>
<p id="p_15">	Heard the learned counsel appearing for parties and perused the materials available on record.
</p><p id="p_16">	15.	<a href="/doc/154851984/" id="a_8">Sections 1</a> to <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_9">120</a> and <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_10">Sections 122</a> to <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_11">185</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003, have come into force on 10.06.2003, vide Notification No.S.O.669(E), dated 10th June, 2003.  As per the decision of the Supreme Court in Chattisgarh SEB v.

In case the Cheque is dishonored for any reason whatsoever, the High Tension consumer will be required to pay the High Tension bills in cash or by demand draft thereafter. If the payment is not received within fifteen days (notice period) from the expiry of the due date allowed for payment, the supply will be disconnected. However the consumer may be 
allowed extension of time to make payment beyond the expiry of the notice period allowed for payment, on an application made to the designated authority of the Distribution Licensee, subject to the levy of BPSC as specified in this Code.

<p id="p_232">	22.	Before adverting to the case on merits, let me address the issue, as to the maintainability of the writ petition, on the grounds of availability of an alternative remedy, with the background of the principles of law, settled by the Apex Court, on the powers and discretion of High Courts to entertain the writ petitions, when a statutory alternative remedy is available.
</p>
<p id="p_233">	23.	The Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1133533/" id="a_30">Thansingh Nathmal v. Superintendent of Taxes</a> reported in AIR 1964 SC 1419, at Paragraph 7, held as follows:	
</p><p id="p_234">	"........The jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_31">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution is couched in wide terms and the exercise thereof is not subject to any restrictions except the territorial restrictions which are expressly provided in the Article. But the exercise of the jurisdiction is discretionary; it is not exercised merely because it is lawful to do so. The very amplitude of the jurisdiction demands that it will ordinarily be exercised subject to certain self-imposed limitations. Resort to that jurisdiction is not intended as an alternative remedy for relief which may be obtained in a suit or other mode prescribed by statute. Ordinarily the Court will not entertain a petition for a writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_32">Art. 226</a>, where the petitioner has an alternative remedy which, without being unduly onerous, provides an equally efficacious remedy. Again the High Court does not generally enter upon a determination of questions which demand an elaborate examination of evidence to establish the right to enforce which the writ is claimed. The High Court does not therefore act as a court of appeal against the decision of a court or tribunal, to correct errors of fact, and does not by assuming jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_33">Art. 226</a> trench upon an alternative remedy provided by statute for obtaining relief. Where it is open to the aggrieved petitioner to move another tribunal, or even itself in another jurisdiction for obtaining redress in the manner provided by a statute, the High Court normally will not permit, by entertaining a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_34">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution, the machinery created under the statute to be by-passed, and will leave the party applying to it to seek resort to the machinery so set up."

</p><p id="p_236">	"Much water has since flown beneath the bridge, but there has been no corrosive effect on these decisions which though old, continue to hold the field with the result that law as to the jurisdiction of the High Court in entertaining a Writ Petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_36">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, in spite of the alternative statutory remedies, is not affected, specially in a case where the authority against whom the Writ is filed is shown to have had no jurisdiction or had purported to usurp jurisdiction without any legal foundation."

</p><p id="p_241">	"22. Apart from the fact that a statutory authority cannot consider the validity of a Statute, as has been urged before us by Mr. Choudhari, it is beyond any doubt or dispute that availability of an alternative remedy by itself may not be a ground for the High Court to refuse to exercise its jurisdiction. It may exercise its writ jurisdiction despite the fact that an alternative remedy is available, inter alia, in a case where the same would not be an efficacious one.
</p><p id="p_242">	23. Furthermore, when an order has been passed by an authority without jurisdiction or in violation of the principles of natural justice, the superior courts shall not refuse to exercise their jurisdiction although there exists an alternative remedy. In this context, it is appropriate to refer to the  observations made by this Court in the case of  <a href="/doc/172383107/" id="a_45">Whirlpool Corporation v.

It was also observed that in pursuance of such self-evolved judicial policy and in conformity with the self-imposed internal restrictions that the Courts insist that the aggrieved person should first allow the due operation and implementation of the law concerned and exhaust the remedies provided by it before approaching the High Court and this Court to invoke their discretionary, extraordinary and equitable jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 32, respectively and that such jurisdiction by its very nature has to be used sparingly and in circumstances, where no other efficacious remedy is available. However, having held as above, Their Lordships also observed that all the self-imposed restrictions in respect of detention orders would have to be respected as it would otherwise frustrate the very purpose for which such detention orders are passed for a limited purpose."

<p id="p_333">	35.	<a href="/doc/172527/" id="a_65">In Maharastra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd., v. Lloyds Steel Industries Ltd</a>., reported in AIR 2008 SC 1042 = 2007 (8) SCC 381, the Supreme Court tested the correctness of a judgment passed by the Appellate Tribunal of the Electricity Board.  In the above reported case, the respondent-Company approached the Maharastra Regulatory Commission, with the prayer that the demand notice issued by the Maharastra Electricity State Distribution Ltd., to be declared as illegal and consequently, to be quashed.  An adverse order was passed against the Company.  Being aggrieved by the same, a petition was filed before the Maharastra Electricity Regulatory Commission.  An objection was raised, stating that the Commission had no jurisdiction, in view of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_66">Section 42</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003 and that the consumer should only approach the Consumer Greivances Redressal Forum.  The Commission overruled the objection and directed refund of some amount to the Company.  Being aggrieved by the same, the appellant therein approached the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, created under the Act and that the Tribunal has affirmed the order passed by the Commission.  Review Petition was filed by the appellant therein was also dismissed.  Being aggrieved by the abovesaid orders, the appellant therein filed a Special Leave Petition before the Apex Court and after considering the provisions, the Supreme Court, at Paragraph 7, held as follows:
</p><p id="p_334">	"7. As per the aforesaid provision, if any grievance is made by a consumer, then they have a remedy under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_67">Section 42(5)</a> of the Act and according to sub-section (5) every distribution licensee has to appoint a forum for redressal of grievances of the consumers. In exercise of this power the State has already framed The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum and Ombudsman) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as "2003 Regulations") and created Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum and Ombudsman. Under these 2003 Regulations a proper forum for redressal of the grievances of individual consumers has been created by the Commission. Therefore, now by virtue of sub-section (5) of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_68">Section 42</a> of the Act, all the individual grievances of consumers have to be raised before this forum only. In the face of this statutory provision we fail to understand how could the Commission acquire jurisdiction to decide the matter when a forum has been created under the Act for this purpose. The matter should have been left to the said forum. This question has already been considered and decided by a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in the cases of Suresh Jindal Vs. BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd. &amp; Ors. reported in 132 (2006) DLT 339 (DB) and Dheeraj Singh Vs. BSES Yamuna Power Ltd. and we approve of these decisions. It has been held in these decisions that the Forum and Ombudsman have power to grant interim orders. Thus a complete machinery has been provided in <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_69">Section 42(5)</a> and <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_70">42(6)</a> for redressal of grievances of individual consumers. Hence wherever a Forum/Ombudsman have been created the consumers can only resort to these bodies for redressal of their grievances. Therefore, not much is required to be discussed on this issue. As the aforesaid two decisions correctly lay down the law when an individual consumer has a grievance he can approach the forum created under sub-section (5) of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_71">Section 42</a> of the Act."
</p><p id="p_335">	Let me also consider some of the decisions rendered by this Court and other High Courts.

<p id="p_336">	36.	In W.P.(MD)No.3148 of 2008, dated 26.06.2008 [<a href="/doc/484729/" id="a_72">A.A.A.P.Angamuthu v. The Assistant Engineer (Town</a>)], an order passed by the Assistant Engineer (Town), Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, Melur, directing the petitioner to pay a sum of Rs.24,581/-, was challenged.  The Board has contended that without obtaining a temporary service connection for construction, the petitioner had utilised the electricity supply from the disconnected service connection given to his father, for commercial purpose and hence, liable to pay Rs.50/- per day, for 385 days, totalling a sum of Rs.24,581/-.  The petitioner has defended the action, contending inter alia that when the construction was started in the year 2004, the original service was disconnected.  The construction was completed in March' 2006.  The service connection was restored on 04.04.2006.  The Electricity Department has chosen to wrongly calculate the amount, based on the previous alleged use of electricity, which is contrary to law.  Taking note of the objections of the respondents, as to the maintainability of the writ petition, on the grounds of availability of an alternative remedy, before the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum, a learned single Judge of this Court, by order, dated 26.06.2008, dismissed the writ petition, as not maintainable.  At Paragraph 7, this Court held as follows:
</p><p id="p_337">	"7.On the basis of the Regulations for Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum and Electricity Ombudsman, 2004, in particular Regulation No.3, which contemplates the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum is constituted and as per Regulation No.4, the said Forum has jurisdiction to entertain the complaints in respect of distribution licensee and the nature of the grievances that can be redressed under Regulation 5, which excludes as follows:-

The dispute was with reference to the payment of proportionate cost of an independent feeder.  The petitioner therein sought for a direction not to disconnect the electric connection.  Taking note of the objections, regarding the maintainability of the writ petition, on the grounds that a statutory alternative remedy is available to the petitioner, for redressal before the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum, and the judgment of the Apex Court in Maharastra State Electricity Distribution Ltd., case (cited supra), the Uttaranchal High Court, has dismissed the writ petition, as hereunder,

Reliance Energy Ltd. and Others and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. Vs.

(2007) 8 SCC 381 wherein the Court held that where the Statute concerned had created a proper forum/ombudsman for the redressal of grievances of individual consumers, the consumers can only resort to these bodies for redressal of their grievances. The proper forum in such cases is thus <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_85">Section 42(5)</a>, and thereafter, <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_86">Section 42(6)</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003.
</p><p id="p_347">	9. The appellate jurisdiction conferred on this court by Section 42 of the Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 is quite different. It is conferred for the purpose of hearing grievances against orders that have been passed under the Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 only, and that cannot be read to mean that the appellate jurisdiction conferred under that Act is also exercisable with regard to the orders passed under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_87">Section 42(5)</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003, which is an entirely different statute. Therefore, to my mind, the reliance of learned counsel for the appellant on Section 42 of the Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 is misconceived.
</p><p id="p_348">	10. Looking to the grievance of the appellant, it is obvious that even the original jurisdiction under the Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 was not available to him. It is perhaps for the reason that he did not approach the Commission under the Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 and moved the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum under the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_88">Electricity Act</a>, 2003, instead.
</p><p id="p_349">	11. Since the dispute raised by the appellant did not fall within the purview of the jurisdiction exercised by the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission under the Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 in the first place, there can be no question of the right of appeal to the High Court envisaged under the said Act being available to the appellant. The High Court exercises appellate jurisdiction against the orders of various forums including the Civil and Criminal Courts, as also against the decisions of various bodies constituted under diverse statutes. The scope and availability of the appellate jurisdiction when exercised by the High Court in any manner is circumscribed by the relevant statute under which the same is envisaged.
</p><p id="p_350">	12. For all these reasons, I find that this court does not have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal and the same is not maintainable on this ground.
</p><p id="p_351">	13. The appeal is accordingly dismissed."

The Deputy Chief Engineer</a>], pursuant to an inspection conducted by the Anti Power Theft Squad, it was found that one phase of the digital meter installed in the petitioner's premises was defective.  The demand made by the Board was disputed.  The objection made by the petitioner therein was overrulled and he was informed that if he is still aggrieved, he can move the Deputy Chief Engineer, Electrical Circle, Ernakulam, after remitting 50% of the said amount.  The Board counsel objected to the maintainability of the writ petition, on the ground that the remedy lies before the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum.  Accepting the said submission, the Kerala High Court, by order, dated 04.02.2011, dismissed the writ petition, granting liberty to the petitioner therein, to move the Forum.

The writ petition has been defended both on merits, and on the grounds of availability of an alternative remedy before the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum.

</p><p id="p_354">	"18. For the foregoing reasonings and the discussion made, as this Court cannot sit over the assessment/re-assessment of the electricity consumption charges, and as an alternative statutory remedy of approaching the said Forum is available for the petitioner for redressal of the grievance, the petitioner/consumer may approach the said Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum.

<p id="p_357">	42.	Regulations for Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum and Electricity Ombudsman, 2004, makes it clear that any defect or deficiency, in respect of electricity service, as defined in Regulation 2(l), stated supra, also covers electricity supply, metering, billing, maintenance of electrical energy, maintenance of distribution system and all other attendant sub-service etc. Even taking it for granted that the licencee had not notified the details of the Consumer Grievances Redressal Forum, it shall not confer any right to the petitioner to straightaway approach the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_93">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, for the reason that the Regulations for Consumer Grievances Redressal Forum and Electricity Ombudsman, 2004 have been notified in the Government Gazettee, dated 18th February' 2004 (Issue No.6A).
</p>	
<p id="p_358">	43.	Once the Regulations have been notified in the Government Gazettee, it is deemed to have been notified to all the general public.  The  Regulations also contain Annexure No.1, prescribing a format of the complaint and also matters, upon which, a complaint could be made.  As per Regulation 4, subject to the other provisions of these Regulations, the forum shall have jurisdiction to entertain the complaints within the jurisdiction of the distribution licensee.  If there is more than one forum in the same licensee's area, then the area of jurisdiction may be decided by the licensee, in accordance with sub-clause 3(2).  The kind of grievances that can be taken up and adjudicated by the forum, are also mentioned under Regulation 5.  Filing and handling procedures have been set out in, Regulations 6 and 7 respectively.  	
</p>
<p id="p_359">	44.	The very purpose of creation of the Regulations for Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum and Electricity Ombudsman, 2004, presided over by a Superintending Engineer and two other members, and devising a comprehensive procedure, as to how the complaint has to be made, with reference to Regulations 3 to 17 and more particularly, to the defect, deficiency and electricity service, which includes, "electricity supply", "metering", "billing", "maintenance of electrical energy", "maintenance of distribution system" and all other sub service, etc., clearly indicate that the above aspects are technical in nature and that therefore, the Forum headed by a Superintending Engineer and two other members, can very well  adjudicate all the issues and decide, comprehensively.  Disputed facts can also be adjudicated before the Forum.  At the risk of repetition, Regulation 7(4) to (10) of the Regulations for Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum and Ombudsman, 2004, are extracted hereunder:
</p><p id="p_360">	"(4) A copy of the admitted complaint shall be forwarded simultaneously to the nodal officer of the concerned licensee for redressal or to file objection in writing if the licensee is not agreeable to the request of the complainant.
</p><p id="p_361">	(5) The licensee shall furnish the para-wise comments on the grievance within 15 days of receipt of the letter from the forum, failing which the forum shall proceed on the basis of the material record available. The complainant can represent himself or through a representative of his choice. Where the complainant or his representative fails to appear on the date of hearing before the forum, the forum may either dismiss the complaint for default or decide it on merits.
</p><p id="p_362">	(6) The forum shall be entitled to call for any record of the licensee and also from the complainant in respect of the grievance received by the forum for examination and disposal of the grievances.
</p><p id="p_363">	(7) On receipt of the comments from the licensee or otherwise, the forum shall complete enquiry as expeditiously as possible and every endeavour shall be made to pass appropriate order on the complaint within a maximum period of 2 months from the date of receipt of complaint by the forum.
</p><p id="p_364">	(8) All decisions shall be taken by a majority of votes by the members present and in the event of the equality of the votes, the facts may be recorded and referred to the Electricity Ombudsman.for final orders. All the members present shall sign every order passed by the forum. The decisions of the forum shall be strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the rules and regulations made thereunder and in particular the Tamil Nadu Electricity Supply Code and the Tamil Nadu Electricity Distribution Code and the directions of the Commission and it is not open to the Members and the Chairperson of the Forum to deviate either expressly or impliedly from the provisions of the Act or the rules or regulations made thereunder or the Tamil Nadu Electricity Supply Code or the Tamil Nadu Electricity Distribution Code or the directions of the Commission while taking the decisions by the forum.
</p><p id="p_365">	(9) The proceedings and decisions of the forum along with time-frame for compliance shall be recorded and communicated to the complainant and licensee for compliance.
</p><p id="p_366">	(10) The licensee shall implement the decisions of the forum within the time-frame specified in the order and report compliance to the forum within 5 days of the implementation of the order.	
</p>
<p id="p_367">	45.	Billing problems, deficiency in service and other complaints, can be very well as raised in the complaint format, as provided in Annexure-I of the said Regulations.  Thus, reading of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_94">Electricity Act</a>, Regulations framed by the Tamil Nadu Regulatory Commission, makes it abundantly clear that the Act and the Regulations framed, are self contained and that comprehensive regulations have been framed.  A Forum has been constituted to redress the complaints, specified therein.  
</p>
<p id="p_368">	46.	Remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_95">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, is available only if there is no other alternate and efficacious remedy.  The above principle is of course only to certain exceptions.  The questions to be considered at this juncture, is whether the alternative remedy available is efficacious, meaningful and not onerous.  The dictionary meaning of the word efficacious is given below:
</p><p id="p_369">	(i) In Webstar's Dictionary, efficacious means, having the power to produce a desired effect;
</p><p id="p_370">	(ii) In Oxford Dictionary, efficacious means, (of something inanimate or abstract) successful in producing a desired or intended result; effective.
</p><p id="p_371">	(iii) In Chamber's Dictionary, efficacious means, able to produce the result intended
</p><p id="p_372">	(iv) In The Penguin Dictionary of English Synonyms, efficacious means, effectual, effective, powerful, active, operative, efficient, energetic of adequate power. 
</p>	
<p id="p_373">	47.	The Allahabad High Court in Mohamood Ilahi v. Dayawati reported in 1989 (1) All.RC 105, has explained the said term as follows:
</p><p id="p_374">	In fact, the word efficacious is adjective according to grammer and its noun is efficacy.  The word efficacy' is derived from Latin word efficacie which means capacity to produce results.  The word 'efficacious'  accordingly means able to produce the intended effect or result.  In case the relief which can be obtained by other usual mode is equally efficacious meaning thereby equally able to produce the result which was intended by the plaintiff, then only injunction can be refused.  Even there must be no doubt about the said relief being obtained because the legislature has used the word 'certainly'.

</p><p id="p_375">	48.	The remedy provided under the Statute should not only be alternative, but also efficacious.   The remedy provided under the Statute, should be meaningful and not onerous. In the above background, when this Court examined the statutory provisions and the regulations framed, as to whether, the statutory provisions envisage a meaningful and efficacious remedy to the aggrieved person to vindicate his grievances to a competent authority for redressing the same and whether, the statutory authority or the Forum, constituted under the Act, is assigned the jurisdiction to adjudge the complaints/disputes, in a efficacious manner,  the answer is in affirmative.	
</p>
<p id="p_376">	49.	Thus, it could be seen that a outer time limit has also been prescribed in the regulations, as to the disposal of the complaints and the implementation of the orders, by the licencee.  The remedy available to the petitioner cannot be said to be not efficacious.  Therefore, after exhausting the alternative remedy available under the Act and the Regulations, a consumer can approach the High Court, for judicial review.  The object and the purpose, for which, a forum has been created should not be allowed to be defeated, by entertaining writ petitions, directly, except, in exceptional circumstances.  
</p>
<p id="p_377">	50.	When the Regulations have come into force from 10.06.2004  and that when every district is stated to have a Consumer Grievances Redressal Forum, presided over by a Superintending Engineer, Electricity Board and two other members, nothing prevented the petitioner from approaching the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum. The decision relied on by Mr.G.Vasudevan, learned counsel for the respondent-Board would lend support to the contention that in respect of a dispute, over the determination of Current Consumption Charges, the petitioner cannot as a matter of right, approach this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_96">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India and that he can only approach the Forum, created for redressal of the complaints/disputes.  In the light of the statutory provisions, this Court is of the view that a writ petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_97">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, for a Mandamus, is not maintainable and hence, it is liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_378">	51.	Perusal of the Regulations for Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum and Electricity Ombudsman, 2004, does not indicate any provision for passing any interim order of stay, direction, etc.  In a given case of disconnection, the user of the electricity supply, would put to hardship.  A complaint or dispute is envisaged, against an order or proceedings or action of the competent authorities, under the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_98">Electricity Act</a> and the Regulations framed thereunder.  Though it is not captioned as an appeal, yet, in the case of disconnection or imposition of penalty or excess demand or in such other cases, entailing civil consequences or serious hardship, the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum, has to consider the merits of each case and pass appropriate interim orders.  Otherwise, in the case of disconnection or penal action, taken by the Board and the other authorities under the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_99">Electricity Act</a>, the complainant has to wait till the disposal of the complaints/disputes, which may take sometime, though as per Regulation 7(7), the forum shall complete enquiry as expeditiously as possible and every endeavour shall be made to pass appropriate order on the complaint within a maximum period of 2 months from the date of receipt of complaint by the forum.  On the aspect of granting interim orders, this Court deems it fit to consider the following decisions, 

</p><p id="p_379">	52.	<a href="/doc/593132/" id="a_100">In Commissioner of Income-Tax v. Bansi Dhar</a> reported in 1986 (1) SCC 523, the Supreme Court, at Paragraphs 40 to 42, held as follows:	
</p><p id="p_380">	"40.	It has to be borne in mind that in answering questions or disposing of references either under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_101">section 66</a> of 1922 Act or <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_102">section 256</a> of 1961 Act, the High Courts do not exercise any jurisdiction conferred upon them by the Code of Civil Procedure or the Charters or by the Acts establishing respective High Courts. In respect of certain matters jurisdictions exercised by the High Court, must be kept separate from the concept of inherent powers or incidental powers in exercising jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_103">section 66</a> of 1922 Act or 256 of 1961 Act. <a href="/doc/711469/" id="a_104">Section 66</a> of Income-Tax Act of 1922 or <a href="/doc/1908938/" id="a_105">section 256</a> of Income-Tax Act of 1961 is a special jurisdiction of a limited nature conferred not by the Code of Civil Procedure or by the Charters or by the special Acts constituting such High Courts but by the special provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_106">Income-Tax Act</a> 1922 or 1961 for limited purpose of obtaining High Court's opinion on questions of law. In giving that opinion properly if any question of incidental or ancillary power arises such as giving an opportunity or restoring a reference dismissed without hearing or giving some additional time to file paper book, such powers inhered to the Jurisdiction conferred upon it. But such incidental powers can not be so construed as to confer the power of stay of recovery of taxes pending a reference which lie in the domain of an appellate authority. Therefore, the concept of granting stay in a reference ex debito justitiae does not arise. That concept might arise in case of the appellate authority exercising its power to grant stay where there is not express provision. Ex debito justitiae is to do justice between the parties.
</p><p id="p_381">	41.	Rendering advice on the question of law referred to the courts has nothing to do with the recovery of tax or granting stay in respect of the same.
</p><p id="p_382">	42.	Therefore, in our opinion it cannot be said that the High Court had inherent power or incidental power in the matter of a reference pending before it to grant stay of realisation or to grant injunction. That must remain within the jurisdiction of the appellate authority and pendency of a reference does not detract from that jurisdiction of the appellate authority. In our opinion, therefore, the High Court was in error in exercising its jurisdiction by passing an order for stay of realisation under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure in a pending reference. The High Court could have exercised its power if the appellate authority had not properly exercised its jurisdiction, not in reference jurisdiction but by virtue of its jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_107">article 226</a> or <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_108">article 227</a> in appropriate cases. But that was not the case here."

<p id="p_383">	53.	<a href="/doc/1218139/" id="a_109">In Lipton India Ltd., v. Assistant Commissioner (CT</a>) reported in 1994 (95) STC 216, this Court, at Paragraphs 17 to 20, held as follows:
</p>	
<p id="p_384">	"17. It is not as if such a question never arose for consideration on prior occasions before superior courts of jurisdiction and the plain fact is such a question did come to be canvassed, on occasions more than one, and some of the precedents in that behalf may now be examined to solve the tangle posed in the issue in question.
</p><p id="p_385">	18. The case in Burhanpur Tapti Mill Ltd. v. Board of Revenue, Madhya Pradesh [1955] 6 STC 670 (Nag) may be referred to first. In that case, the petitioners were assessees under the C.P. and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947 (for short "the Act"). They were assessed to sales tax which was duly paid by them. The Commissioner of Sales Tax, however, reopened the assessment under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_110">Section 22B</a> of the Act and remitted the case to the Regional Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax, Amravati, for making a fresh assessment. Against the order of the Commissioner of Sales Tax, the petitioners appealed to the Board of Revenue, which is the Appellate Tribunal under Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_111">Section 22B</a>. The petitioners made an application to the Board of Revenue to stay the proceedings before the Regional Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax, but the application was rejected on the ground that there was no provision in the Act in regard to stay of proceedings. The aggrieved petitioners challenged the said order of the Board of Revenue before the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur in writ proceedings. Learned single Judge of that court while deciding that matter expressed thus (at pages 671-672) :
</p><p id="p_386">	"3............'.Since an appeal is expressly provided in Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_112">Section 22B</a> of the Sales Tax Act, it is implicit that the Board of Revenue can exercise all the powers which are necessary for the proper disposal of the appeal. The law on the subject is laid down in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Edition, on page 361 in the following terms :--
</p><p id="p_387">	'Where an Act confers a jurisdiction, it impliedly also grants the power of doing all such acts, or employing such means, as are essentially necessary to its execution. Cui jurisdictio explicari non potuit.'
</p><p id="p_388">	4. The order impugned reopens the assessment on certain grounds. The Board of Revenue is empowered to decide whether the principles of assessment set down by the Commissioner of Sales Tax are proper. If there was no scope for reopening the assessment, the resultant proceedings before the Regional Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax would be an abuse of the process of the Court. It seems axiomatic that where the Legislature invests an Appellate Tribunal with powers to prevent an injustice, it impliedly empowers it to stay the proceedings which may result in causing further mischief. In such cases the refusal to stay the proceedings may make the appeal itself nugatory, if a reassessment is made in the meantime requiring the assessee to file another and costly appeal. A view of law which leads to such onerous results is prima facie untenable.
</p><p id="p_389">	5. It is no doubt true that in the Code of Civil Procedure, there is a specific provision, namely, <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_113">Section 151</a>, relating to the inherent powers of courts. But that section does not create any new right and only enunciates the powers which are exercisable by courts for the ends of justice or to prevent the abuse of any legal process : Hukum Chand Boid v. Kamalnand Singh ILR 33 Cal 927, followed in <a href="/doc/469517/" id="a_114">Nand Kishore Singh v. Ram Golam Sahu, ILR</a> 40 Cal 955. <a href="/doc/1073704/" id="a_115">In Janki Das v. Sheo Prasad ILR</a> 54 All. 344 and <a href="/doc/545621/" id="a_116">Asadali Chowdhury v. Mahamed Hossain Chowdhury ILR</a> 43 Cal 986, it was held that the appellate court can exercise powers of stay even if order 41, Rule 5, Civil Procedure Code, is not in terms applicable. The principle underlying these decisions is that courts of law have got the power, apart from any express provision, to further the ends of justice and prevent harassment to the parties. What applies to the courts of law also applies to quasi-judicial Tribunals. Therefore, since the Board of Revenue has the power to adjudge the correctness of the impugned order, it has also the power to stay the proceedings in pursuance of that order."
</p><p id="p_390">	19. Secondly, the case of <a href="/doc/773914/" id="a_117">State of Orissa v. Member, Sales Tax Tribunal</a> [1971] 28 STC 652 (Orissa) may be adverted to. In that case, as against the orders of assessments, appeals had been preferred before the Commissioner of Sales Tax. The appeals were dismissed. Second appeals were preferred before the Sales Tax Tribunal. During the pendency of the second appeals, the Tribunal granted interim stay. Writ petition had been filed challenging the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to grant stay during the pendency of second appeals. The Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947 (Act 14 of 1947) underwent amendments on occasions more than one, initially in the year 1955, then in the year 1957 and finally in the year 1968. Initially there was no provision conferring power on the Tribunal to grant stay. However, the provision to grant power, which had been introduced by the 1955 Act, was, however, not brought into force ; and later such a provision was, in fact, omitted by the 1957 Act. After the passing of the 1968 Act, the Commissioner alone was competent to grant stay, during the pendency of the second appeal and the Tribunal, has no such power. In such a situation, the point that arose for consideration was whether the Tribunal has the power to grant the stay.
</p><p id="p_391">	(a) In a bid to find out an answer to such a question, their Lordships of the Division Bench of the Orissa High Court referred to the case of the <a href="/doc/736105/" id="a_118">Income-Tax Officer, Cannanore v. M.K.Mahammed</a> [1969] 71 ITR 815 (SC), as that case threw light directly on the question in issue--though it arose out of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_119">Income-tax Act</a>, 1961.
</p><p id="p_392">	(i) <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_120">Section 254(1)</a> of that Act deals with orders of the Appellate Tribunal. Sub-section (1.) thereof lays down that the Appellate Tribunal may, after giving both the parties to the appeal an opportunity of being heard, pass such orders thereon as it thinks fit. Indisputably powers have not been expressly conferred upon the Appellate Tribunal to stay proceedings relating to the recovery of penalty or tax due from an assessee. Under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_121">Section 220(6)</a>, power of stay by treating the assessee, as not being in default during the pendency of an appeal has been given to the Income-tax Officer only when an appeal has been presented under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_122">Section 246</a> to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. Thus, there is express provision in the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_123">Income-tax Act</a> for stay of proceedings by the Income-tax Officer relating to recovery of penalty and tax when first appeal is pending, but there is no corresponding express provision to grant stay when the second appeal is pending before the Appellate Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_393">	(ii) Despite the absence of such express provision for grant of stay, their Lordships held that the Tribunal had implied powers to grant stay. The logic through which such a conclusion was reached is based on the basic principle to be found in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, Eleventh Edition, at page 350. The statement is that "where an Act confers a jurisdiction, it impliedly also grants the power of doing all such acts, or employing such means ; as are essentially necessary to its execution".
</p><p id="p_394">	(iii) Their Lordships applied the above principle to the wide, powers exercised by the Tribunal under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_124">Section 254(1)</a>, They concluded thus :
</p><p id="p_395">	"If the Income-tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner have made assessments or imposed penalties raising very large demands and if the Appellate Tribunal is entirely helpless in the matter of stay of recovery, the entire purpose of the appeal can be defeated if ultimately the orders of the departmental authorities are set aside. It is difficult to conceive that the Legislature should have left the entire matter to the administrative authorities to make such orders as they choose to pass in exercise of unfettered discretion. The assessee, as has been pointed out before, has no right to even move an application when an appeal is pending before the Appellate Tribunal under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_125">Section 220(6)</a> and it is only at the earlier stage of appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner that the statute provides for such a matter being dealt with by the Income-tax Officer."
</p><p id="p_396">	(iv) Their Lordships' ultimate conclusion was summed up in paragraph 8 as follows :
</p><p id="p_397">	"In our opinion the Appellate Tribunal must be held to have the power to grant stay as incidental or ancillary to its appellate jurisdiction. This is particularly so when <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_126">Section 220(6)</a> deals expressly with a situation when an appeal is pending before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, but the Act is silent in that behalf when an appeal is pending before the Appellate Tribunal. It could well be said that when <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_127">Section 254</a> confers appellate jurisdiction, it impliedly grants the power, of doing all such acts, or employing such mean's, as are essentially necessary to its execution and that the statutory power carries with it the duty in proper cases to make such orders for staying proceeding as will prevent the appeal if successful from being rendered nugatory."
</p><p id="p_398">	(b) After penning down the ultimate conclusion of their Lordships of the Supreme Court, the Division Bench of the Orissa High Court deduced the following two propositions :
</p><p id="p_399">	(i) Where an Act confers a jurisdiction, it impliedly also grants the power of doing all such acts or employing such means as are essentially necessary to its execution. This implied power is incidental and ancillary to the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_400">	(ii) If, however, the statute confers express power on any authority to deal with a particular contingency, then by necessary implication that particular power is to be taken as excluded from the ambit of implied power. In other words, the theory of implied powers cannot be invoked when express jurisdiction has been conferred on any authority to exercise a particular power.
</p><p id="p_401">	20. Coming to the facts of the case on hand, as already adverted to, stay of giving effect to the remand order had alone been prayed for on all those stay applications and nothing more. Such a relief is capable of being granted only by the invocation of the implied or incidental or ancillary power, implicit in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction conferred on the Tribunal, if the facts and circumstances of the case so warrant, and to say that the Tribunal has no such power, as had been done here, cannot at all be reflecting the reality of the situation, in the light of the law, as laid down by the superior courts cited supra. The resultant position would be that the composite order impugned has to be necessarily quashed and the same is accordingly quashed."  (emphasis supplied)

As stated supra, when option was given to the learned counsel for the petitioner to approach the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum, he insisted for judicial review, on the ground that the licencee had not notified the address and other particulars of the Forum in the Media.  Therefore, in the abovesaid circumstances, this Court deems it fit to consider, as to whether, the Electricity Board has assessed the Current Consumption Charges, in accordance with the statutory provisions and the Regulations framed by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Supply Code, 2004.

Its jurisdiction is circumscribed and confined to correct errors of law or procedural error, if any, resulting in manifest miscarriage of justice or violation of principles of natural justice.

Whereas, the petitioner has sought for a Mandamus, to assess the Current Consumption Charges, for the service connection No.181-32-18, for the period between 20.03.2013 to May' 2013, as contemplated under Regulation 11(2) of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Supply Code, 2004.

Ltd., T.Nagar, Chennai-17, that from September' 2011 to March' 2012, the Current Consumption Charges ranges from 3630 to 3240 Units.  But then, ie., from May' 2012, there has been a sharp decrease in the Current Consumption Charges and in the subsequent months, there is a clear variation in Current Consumption Charges.  The Current Consumption Charges, which were between 3240 and 3620 Units, has gone down upto 380 Units.  The assessment of billing in cases, where there is no meter or meter is defective, has been done, as per Regulation 11 of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Supply Code, 2004.

In view of the gross variation from May' 2012, the respondents have taken into consideration, the average Current Consumption energy, not recorded during the defective period, but based on the reading recorded in the meter, during the preceeding four months (two bi-monthly assessments) of January' 2012 and March' 2012, as follows:

As per Regulation 11 of the Supply Code, 2004, assessment has to be made on the basis of any consecutive four months period during the preceding twelve months when the conditions of working were similar to those in the period covered by the billing.  Thus, as rightly contended by the respondents, the petitioner is seeking to assess the average of the electricity supplied during the period when the meter was defective, instead of the reading, recorded during the consecutive four months period, during the preceding twelve months, when the conditions of working were similar to those in the period covered by the billing.   The contention of the petitioner to the contra, cannot be accepted, in the light of the statutory provisions, stated supra.
</p><p id="p_416">	62.	In the light of the principles of law, as regards, exercise of judicial review, by the High Court, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_136">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, there is no manifest illegality in the decision-making process, in assessing the Current Consumption Charges, for the period between May' 2012 to July' 2013, nor the decision can be said to have suffered from any arbitrariness, perversity or mala fides, warranting interference.  There is no breach of law or any constitutional provision, as alleged by the petitioner.  The decision relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioner is inapplicable to the facts of this case.   On the facts and circumstances of the case and in the light of the provisions, the writ petition, is not maintainable, without approaching the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum.  The aspect relating to disconnection of supply is also a matter to be adjudicated before the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum.  As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondents, the petitioner has not challenged the same.
