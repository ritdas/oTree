</p>


<p id="p_21">15.       Complainant has to prove that accused was engaged in
activity of electroplating and discharging trade effluent without any
treatment facility. To support its case, complainant has examined
two witnesses. Both witnesses have specifically deposed that on
23.04.2000, they visited the unit of accused and during inspection,
it was found that electroplating unit was operational and effluence
from the unit were discharged to the drain without any treatment.
They have further deposed that no ETP / treatment facility was
installed at the premises to treat the effluent. Hence, both the
witnesses are corroborating each other on material facts. Both
witnesses are deposing that they found operating an electroplating
works without any effluent treatment plant to treat the effluents.
Both    witnesses    were   cross-examined          by    the   accused.   Only
suggestions were given in the cross-examination which were denied
by the witnesses. Both witnesses have passed the test of cross-
examination. There is no material contradictions in their testimony.
Except suggestions, nothing important was put to the witness to
impeach their credibility. I do not find any reason to disbelieve the
statement of witnesses. Both witnesses have duly supported the
case of the complainant.
</p>

<p id="p_22">16.       In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it is held
that the complainant has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt
against accused. Accordingly, accused is held guilty and convicted
for offences punishable under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_24">sections 43</a>/<a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_25">44</a> of the Water Act, 1974
