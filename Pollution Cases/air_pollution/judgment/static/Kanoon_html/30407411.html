                                      Judgement

</p><p id="p_2">1.   This is an appeal filed under <a href="/doc/167697689/" id="a_1">Section 16(h)</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act,

     2010 challenging the Environmental Clearance (for short EC) granted to

     Respondent No. 3 National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd. (for short NTPC)

     under the Environment Impact Assessment (for short EIA) Notification, 2006 by

     the Respondent No. 1, Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests (for short MoEF) vide

     order No. J 13012/79/2007-IA.II (T) dated 13.12.2012 for setting up of 2x800

     MW coal based Lara Super Thermal Power Project (for short STPP) at Armuda,

     Chhapora, Bodajharia, Devalpura, Mahloi, Riyapillai, Lara, Jhilgitar and

     Kandagarh villages in Taluk Pussore, District Raigarh, Chhattisgarh contending

     that the approval granted is in clear violation of the 'Precautionary Principle' and

     principle of 'Sustainable Development' and also in violation of principles

     governing administrative decision making, viz. the duty to give reasons and

     application of mind to relevant consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.   The Appellant claims that he is a resident of Raigarh, Chhattisgarh and has been

     involved in environmental activism since several years and he is an active member

     of organization known as Jan Chetna which works on the issues of environment

     across the State of Chhattisgarh and other parts of the country. The Appellant

     submits that initially the Respondent no. 3 submitted proposals to Respondent No.

     1 for granting EC for construction of 5x800 MW capacity STPP (Unit I &amp; Unit II)

     based on Super Critical Technology towards the south-east of Raigarh Town of

     Chhattisgarh state on 18.04.2007 with an estimated requirement of 3500 acres of

     land. Based on the application submitted by the Project Proponent, the Expert

     Appraisal Committee (for short EAC) on environmental impact assessment of

     Thermal Power and Coal Mine Projects of Respondent No. 1 issued Terms of

     Reference (in short ToR) dated 01.08.2007 for preparation of Draft Environment


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                Page 2 of 39</span>
      Impact Assessment Report (in short DEIAR) for 5x800 MW Thermal Power

     Project. The Project Proponent prepared the DEIAR for 2x800 MW Thermal

     Power Project (Stage-I) in January, 2011 followed by a request made to

     Respondent No.1 on 09.03.2011 seeking amendment to the ToR. Thereafter, the

     Respondent No. 1 issued Corrigendum to the ToR on 27.04.2011 amending the

     ToR applicable to 2x800 MW in place of 5x800 MW.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.   The Appellant contended that the DEIAR prepared by the Project Proponent is not

     in accordance with the ToR dated 01.08.2007, though Para 2.2 of Appendix - IV

     of the EIA Notification, 2006 mandates preparation of DEIAR strictly in

     accordance with ToR communicated to the Project Proponent after scoping. As

     per the Appellant, the issues on which EIA has been carried out by the Project

     Proponent in contravention of ToR, are as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         i.    ToR dated 01.08.2007 were issued for preparation of EIA Report with

               regard to 5x800 MW whereas both the draft and final EIA Reports

               have been prepared for 2x800 MW (Stage-I). The Appellant states that

               though the corrigendum issued to the ToR provides for change in the

               unit configuration from 5x800 MW to 2x800 MW it does stipulate that

               the EIA study shall be carried out for 5x800 MW but the EIA report is

               confined to only 2x800 MW and not the ultimate capacity 5x800 MW.

</blockquote><p id="p_5">        ii.    As per condition No. (ii) of the ToR, the EIA Report was required to

               provide information about coordinates (all the four corners) of the

               project site as well as the ash pond with Toposheet. But in the DEIAR

               only single coordinate (21°44'48" N and 83°26'00'' E) has been

               mentioned. Furnishing of information on all the four coordinates in the

               DEIAR is required to ensure that the exact boundaries are disclosed to

               the public and they are aware of the exact location of the project during

               the public hearing as the location of STPP and its associated facilities

               such as ash pond, has serious social and environmental impact and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                               Page 3 of 39</span>
        same is of critical importance for deciding the environmental viability

       of the project.
</p>
<p id="p_6">iii.   With regard to land requirement, the Project Proponent is supposed to

       optimize the land utilization as per the ToR condition No. (vi) with full

       details of item-wise land availability along with plant layout but the

       Project Proponent informed that for Stage-I approximately 2375 acres

       of land will be required and 525 acres of additional land will be

       required for ash dyke of Stage-II making it unclear as to why the

       provision of requirement of land for ash dyke for Stage-II was included

       as a part of Stage-I. Though, as per the guidelines of the Central

       Electricity Authority (for short CEA) issued in September, 2010 an

       area of 0.77 acre of land per MW of power produced is supposed to be

       taken into account making requirement of about 1232 acres of land for

       the purpose of establishing 2x800 MW = 1600 MW power plant

       whereas, the Project Proponent almost doubled the requirement i.e.

       2375 acres of land and no effort has been made by the Project

       Proponent to optimize the land requirement.
</p>
<p id="p_7">iv.    With regard to quantity of fuel required for the project, the Appellant

       states that the Project Proponent included in the EIA Report that 7.0

       million tons of coal is required per annum which is to be sourced from

       Talaipalli Coal Block. But keeping in view of the fact that coal in the

       area is of Grade 'F' quality with Useful Heat Value (for short UHV)

       ranging between 1310 to 5892 Kcal/Kg making an average of 3601

       Kcal/Kg, the mentioning of 4200 Kcal/Kg in the EIA report is nothing

       but improper assessment of requirement of fuel and not arriving at the

       exact quantity of coal required. Though, the EIA Report states that the

       transportation of coal will be through Merry Go Round (for short

       MGR) of about 60 km. but the effect of transportation for such long

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                       Page 4 of 39</span>
       distance and its overall impact and carrying capacity of the

      environment on the land, water bodies, forest, and habitat is not clear.

v.    As per the condition No. (xxii) of the ToR, data on water quality of

      Kelo and Mahanadi rivers and other water bodies located in the said

      area is supposed to be collected and provided. But the data provided by

      the Project Proponent is out dated and unrealistic. The water in the

      river Kelo has been badly polluted because of industrial activity and the

      data of the water quality of this river provided in <a href="/doc/50331181/" id="a_2">Section 3</a>.7.2 of the

      draft EIA Report is of December 2006 to December 2007. Though, the

      Project Proponent stated that one season data for pre-monsoon season

      of 2011 has been included in the final EIA Report it does not reflect the

      time duration as to when the same has been collected.
</p>
<p id="p_8">vi.   The Appellant in his appeal is very critical about the missing of

      detailed Rehabilitation and Resettlement (for short R&amp;R) plan in the

      draft EIA Report. He states that as per the condition No. (xxviii) of

      ToR detailed R&amp;R plan shall be prepared taking into account of the

      socio-economic status of the area, land oustees and homestead oustees,

      landless labourers but the same has not been furnished by the Project

      Proponent. In the DEIAR, the Project Proponent has stated "details

      will be included in the socio-economic survey". It is blatantly clear

      that the EIA Report has been filed without addressing the very vital

      issue of R&amp;R. The averment of Respondent No. 3 that final R&amp;R plan

      was submitted to the MoEF on 24.08.2012 clearly shows that the same

      was not part of the EIA Report studies neither at the draft nor at the

      final EIA stage. The issue of R&amp;R is a critical component of the ToR

      issued for the project and the R&amp;R plan was not discussed in the EAC.

      Both, the MoEF and the EAC viewed the non-compliance of the ToR

      with regard to R&amp;R in a very casual manner and proceeded to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                       Page 5 of 39</span>
                 recommend the project for approval despite being aware that the R&amp;R

                plan is not in place.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       vii.     With regard to ToR condition No. (xxxii) seeking measures of socio-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                economic influence to the local community proposed to be provided by

                the Project Proponent, the EIA Report is completely silent on this

                aspect and it is only states that "community development activities will

                be taken up after finalization of the plan in consultation with the State

                Government."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">4.   The Appellant further alleged certain other glaring omissions with regard to

     preparation of EIA Report and Environment Management Plan (for short EMP)

     after the expiry of the period of the ToR. He stated that the EIA Report has been

     submitted by the Project Proponent after expiry of the validity period of the ToR.

     Further, the primary data used for preparation of EIA Report is beyond the

     prescribed limit of 3 years and it is based on the data which was 4 years old and

     the same was submitted to the EAC after the validity of ToR i.e. after 31.07.2011

     in violation of the Office Memorandum (for short OM) of the MoEF dated

     22.03.2010 wherein the time limit for the validity of ToR has been prescribed.

</p><p id="p_11">5.   The public hearing of the project was held on 23.12.2011 in Mahloi, Tehsil

     Pussore, District Raigarh, Chhattisgarh and the draft EIA Report was made

     available before the public. The public hearing was not conducted as per the ToR

     and it suffered with substantial irregularities. The Appellant states that there were

     several objections to the project and certain significant environmental issues were

     raised by the participants during the public hearing. The Appellant states that he

     himself (Speaker No. 69) attended the public hearing and raised objections with

     regard to non-compliance of the ToR and placing outdated data before the public.

     According to the Appellant some of the other important issues/objections raised

     by the public during public hearing are:

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                                Page 6 of 39</span>
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">           i.    Requirement of EIA of coal based Thermal Power Projects located in

                the area.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">         ii.    EIA Report is based on old environmental standards.

</blockquote><p id="p_13">        iii.    Detailed river flow assessment and cumulative impact of the project on

                ground water.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        iv.     Impact of the pollution caused to the agricultural lands of farmers.

         v.     No consideration of the nuclear radiation and its impact on human

                habitat.
</p>
<p id="p_15">     Thus, the Appellant, in his appeal has stated that public hearing held on

     23.12.2011 was not properly conducted as the participants were not informed

     about the true impact of the project and the concerns/issues raised by the public

     were not addressed by the EAC while appraising the project. He averred that for

     an effective public participation, it is necessary that there should be full and fair

     disclosure of all the material facts related to the project. He further stated that the

     EAC while dealing with the issues raised during the public hearing adopted a

     casual approach and most of the objections/issues raised during the public hearing

     have not been recorded in the Minutes and there is no mention by the EAC and

     there is nothing on record in the Minutes to show why the EAC has brushed aside

     the objections raised by the participants in the public hearing and how views

     expressed by them are not significant enough to comment upon.

</p><p id="p_16">6.   With regard to the EIA Report, the Appellant alleged the following

     shortcomings/deficiencies :

                MW, the Project Proponent has done it only for 2x800 MW.

         ii.    The EIA lacks proper information on utilization and management of fly

</blockquote><p id="p_17">        iii.    The EIA Report is completely silent on the transport system, land

               requirement and its type.
</p>
<p id="p_18">        iv.    EIA Report does not focus on the management of the ash dykes.

        v.     EIA Report provides incomplete information on the Ambient Air

               Quality (for short AAQ). It is limited to RSPM (PM       10   and PM   2.5),


               Sulphur Dioxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Ozone and Mercury. The other

               pollutants such as Lead, Carbon Monoxide, Ammonia, Benzopyrene,

               Arsenic, and Nickel have not been stated as part of the EIA.

</p><p id="p_19">7.   The Appellant has also prayed in his appeal that no study has been made on

     Volatile Organic Compounds (for short VOCs).
</p>
<p id="p_20">8.   With regard to impact on river Mahanadi the Appellant states that the EIA study

     does not indicate as to whether the river Mahanadi has sufficient water to support

     the project of the Proponent and what would be the cumulative impact on the flow

     of the river during lean season i.e. summer. His contention is that the river

     Mahanadi is already over exploited by creating a number of such industries over

     its banks in the State of Chhattisgarh. He states that the EAC has not made any

     observation with regard to the availability of water in the river Mahanadi for the

     project of Respondent No. 3. He further makes a point that no cumulative impact

     study was conducted on the effect of large scale establishment of industries which

     are dependent on drawing water from the river Mahanadi and without taking into

     account of the availability of water, the project has been recommended by the

     EAC.
</p>
<p id="p_21">9.   The Appellant makes it a point that the EAC did not make any reference nor

     sought any information from the Project Proponent with respect to the possible

     nuclear radiation from coal proposed to be used for the Thermal Power Project but

     recommended the project for clearance simply stating that "a long term study of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                               Page 8 of 39</span>
      radioactive and heavy metal contents on coal to be used, shall be carried out

     through a reputed institute."
</p>
<p id="p_22">10. With regard to the disposal of fly ash generated by the project, the Appellant

     states that the Respondent No. 3, NTPC has not submitted any concrete plan on

     fly ash utilization and the EAC only reiterated the requirement of utilization of fly

     ash without verifying the concrete plan of the Project Proponent prior to issuance

     of EC. The contention of the Appellant is that there are limitations in utilization

     of fly ash generated by the power plants located in the vicinity of the project in

     question and there are not many infrastructure development projects or abandoned

     mines close by to the proposed project and thus, huge quantity of ash generated is

     necessarily to be stored in the NTPC site itself and there are no such sites of ash

     disposal which probably makes plausible dangers of accident and pollution.

</p><p id="p_23">11. Finally, the Appellant prayed that the impugned order dated 13.12.2012 issued by

     the Respondent No. 1 granting EC may be set aside in the interest of protection of

     environment. In the appeal as well as during the hearing, the appellant has quoted

     the following judgments given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, various High

     Courts and National Green Tribunal in support of his averments:

</p><p id="p_25">12. The Respondent No. 3, NTPC (Project Proponent) submitted affidavit dated

    20.05.2013 with detailed para-wise replies countering the allegations made by the

    Appellant in the appeal. It is the case of the Respondent No. 3, NTPC that it is

    true that a proposal was submitted to the MoEF for approval of the draft ToR for

    EIA study for Lara STPP with an ultimate capacity of 5x800 MW vide their letter

    dated 01.08.2007. However, due to delay in allocation of land and water by the

    State Government and also due to delay in the availability of coal from the coal

    mines, it was proposed to implement the project in stages with Stage-I beginning

    with a capacity of 2x800 MW and accordingly feasibility report and EIA Report

    for the project were prepared for 2x800 MW only and on the request, the MoEF

    vide letter dated 27.04.2011 issued corrigendum to the ToR making it for 2x800

    MW. According to the Respondent No. 3, the conditions stipulated in the original

    ToR dated 01.08.2007 as well as corrigendum dated 27.04.2011 were complied

    with at various stages of environmental appraisal of the project. The Respondent

    No. 3 further states that the NTPC makes best efforts to optimize the utilization of

    natural resources like land, water and fuel by adopting the state of the art

    technologies and management practices as NTPC itself was a part of the team

    formulating the CEA guidelines on land requirement for thermal power projects.

    It is a general practice to acquire land for the entire project while feasibility

    reports are prepared in stages as and when other resources such as capital

    investment and coal are made available. The recommendations of the CEA are

    only general in nature and therefore, actual land requirement may vary depending



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                              Page 10 of 39</span>
      on the site conditions and therefore, the contention of the Appellant that the land

     requirement shall be restricted to 0.77 acre/MW may vary slightly on either side

     depending on the site conditions and no excess land has been acquired than what

     is required and whatever land that has been acquired by the NTPC will be put to

     optimum utilization keeping in view the future requirements of the project.

</p><p id="p_26">13. With regard to allegation of the Appellant that the requirement of the coal from

     the Talaipalli Coal Block has not been properly assessed, the Respondent NTPC

     replied that there is no discrepancy as UHV and the Gross Calorific Value (for

     short GCV) are two different characteristics of coal. The design value of coal

     requirement does not correspond to the arithmetic average of minimum and

     maximum value but the weighted average. With regard to the MGR, this aspect

     has been covered during environmental appraisal of the Talaipalli Coal Block

     project and MGR is not a part of the present project of Respondent No. 3.

</p><p id="p_27">14. According to the Respondent NTPC, as per the Technical EIA Guidance Manual

     for Thermal Power Plants prepared by IL&amp;FS for MoEF, only one season data

     (except monsoon) is required for study and therefore, though the EIA Report

     contains the environmental data for the period from December 2006 to November

     2007, the NTPC, as a responsible organization towards environment generated the

     fresh environmental monitoring data for all the disciplines of environment for pre-

     monsoon season of year 2011 and therefore the averments made by the Appellant

     that the DEIAR is based on imperfect data is not correct and the allegation is

     squarely denied.
</p>
<p id="p_28">15. With regard to the alleged shortcomings pointed out by the Appellant on the

     whole process of appraising and granting EC and the replies furnished by the

     Respondent Project Proponent on R&amp;R plan as well as socio-economic and

     demographic aspects, it will be discussed in detail at a later stage in this judgment.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                                 Page 11 of 39</span>
</p><p id="p_29"> 16. The Respondent No. 3 NTPC denied the allegation of the Appellant that OM

     dated 22.03.2010 of MoEF has been violated as ToR were more than 4 years old

     and the environmental data was more than 3 years old and the project was

     appraised on incomplete information. It was stated by the Project Proponent that

     they are fully aware of the provisions of the aforesaid OM and realizing that the

     project was delayed due to delay in allocation of land and water and also due to

     delay in availability of coal the installed capacity was reduced and the MoEF was

     requested to amend the ToR. The MoEF accordingly considered the application

     and amended the ToR by issuing corrigendum dated 27.04.2011. Therefore, the

     Project Proponent has taken up fresh environmental data generation for all the

     disciplines including pre-monsoon season of 2011 and the same was available

     before the public during public hearing and it was included in the final EIA Report

     after public hearing was conducted on 23.12.2011. Thus, there is no violation of

     the aforesaid memorandum and the appraisal taken up by the EAC has been

     approved by the MoEF based on the latest data collected as per the revised ToR.

</p><p id="p_30">17. The issues raised by the members of public during the public hearing were taken

     into account and suitable response/answers were also commented upon and were

     incorporated in the final EIA Report submitted to MoEF which were deliberated

     during the 50th EAC meeting on 26.06.2012 and 56th EAC meeting held on

     04.09.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_31">18. The Project Proponent stated that the company is in touch with various industries

     such as cement and brick manufacturers on utilization of the ash generated by the

     plant and once the project comes into force, the ash will be utilized as per the

     MoEF notification dated 03.11.2009 and therefore, it is not possible to undertake

     the ash utilization activities at the time of preparation of draft EIA Report when

     the project itself was not accorded final clearance and granted approval.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                                 Page 12 of 39</span>
</p><p id="p_32"> 19. With regard to transmission system for the project, the Project Proponent states

     that it is to be implemented by the Power Grid Corporation Ltd., it being the

     public sector undertaking and therefore, this is not a part of the EIA study or

     clearance of project for Lara STPP.
</p>
<p id="p_33">20. According to respondent No. 3, the alleged violation of environmental norms with

     regard to emission and effect of project on the environment, a detailed impact

     analysis was carried out and incorporated in the EIA report and all the parameters

     prescribed under law with regard to environmental standards will be fulfilled and

     implemented. Apprehensions expressed by the Appellant are unfounded and not

     based on any facts.
</p>
<p id="p_34">21. It is the case of the Respondent No. 3 Project Proponent that the cumulative

     impact of the proposed project within the area was undertaken separately and

     submitted to MoEF vide letter dated 21.08.2012.           The same was taken into

     account by the EAC during its 56th meeting held on 04.09.2012 and therefore, it is

     not correct to say that the cumulative impact of the project has not been taken into

     account by the EAC during the appraisal of the project.
</p>
<p id="p_35">22. With regard to effect of the project on environment due to increase of traffic both

     directly and indirectly as a result of setting up of the project, the Appellant states

     that as per the Technical EIA Guidance Manual because of higher levels of

     uncertainties, the cumulative impacts due to induced development or third level or

     even secondary indirect impacts are difficult to be quantified and therefore, the

     apprehensions of the Appellant are unjustified.
</p>
<p id="p_36">23. With regard to the shortage of water in river Mahanadi, excess acquisition of land

     for the project and perceived effect of pollution as alleged by the Appellant in his

     appeal, the respondent NTPC squarely denied the facts by providing details under

     each such allegation which will be dealt in detail while dealing with the issues at

     appropriate place in this judgment.

</p><p id="p_38"> 24. The Respondent No. 1 MoEF filed their reply dated 25.07.2013 denying the

    averments made by the appellant on the alleged shortcomings of appraisal of the

    project by the EAC and subsequent granting of EC by the MoEF.                It was

    mentioned in the counter of MoEF that the EAC in its 56th meeting held on 3rd and

    4th September, 2012 and 60th meeting held on 5th and 6th November, 2012 widely

    deliberated the concerns on various issues and having satisfied itself with the

    proposals of the Project Proponent and after going into the details of the EIA

    Report, recommended for granting EC and the appeal does not demand any merit

    and is liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_39">25. The Respondent No. 2 Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board (for short

    CECB) filed their reply dated 11.07.2013 mainly on the issues pertaining to public

    hearing conducted by the CECB duly stating that the issues raised by the public

    during the public hearing were taken into account while making the report and

    there is no deviation from the procedure prescribed in the EIA Notification, 2006

    at any stage. It was stated that there were about 950 persons who attended the

    public hearing and among them 92 persons have expressed their views which were

    duly recorded. Finally, it was stated in the counter by the CECB that the entire

    procedure of placing documents before the public, conducting public hearing and

    compliance of the procedure has been strictly done as prescribed under the EIA

    notification, 2006 and the appeal does not merit any consideration and is liable for

    dismissal.

<p id="p_40">26. From all the above discussions and deliberations on the issues raised by the

    Appellant as well as the replies furnished by the Respondents and after perusal of

    the records placed before us and having heard the parties at length, the following

    points have emerged for adjudication of this case :

   ii.   Whether non furnishing of information regarding the exact boundaries

        along with coordinates of the proposed project site in the draft EIA report

        and not making them available during the public hearing vitiates the

        whole process of appraisal and granting EC?
</p>
<p id="p_43"> iii.   Whether there is any concealment/suppression or misrepresentation of

        facts on the land acquired, its nature and category for the establishment of

        the project?
</p>
<p id="p_44"> iv.    Whether acquiring the total land in the beginning itself for the ultimate

        capacity of the project i.e. 5x800 MW is in consonance with the

        prescribed norms when the project has been revised to be executed in 2

        stages with stage-I getting EC for installation of 2x800 MW units and in

        such case, the land acquisition for the entire ultimate capacity of 5x800

        MW is permissible?
</p>
<p id="p_45">  v.    Whether the averments made by the Appellant on non-finalization and

        non inclusion of R&amp;R plan both in draft as well as in final EIA report

        and not placing it before the public during public hearing violates the EIA

        Notification 2006?
</p>
<p id="p_46"> vi.    Whether the appraisal of the project is based on outdated data and wrong

        and incomplete EIA study and lack of detailed scrutiny and failure to

        discuss on the Cumulative Impact Assessment study by the EAC, as

        alleged by the Appellant, vitiates the process of granting the EC?

vii.    Does the EIA Report take into account the emission from sources other

        than stack emission and also does it take into account the impact due to

        transmission line?
</p>
<p id="p_47">viii.   Whether the water requirement for the project and the cumulative impact

       ix.      Whether the issues raised during the public hearing have been addressed

               and taken into consideration while finalizing the EIA report based on

               which EAC appraised the project and MoEF granted the EC?

               of the power plant in question, is correct?
</p>
<p id="p_50">27. Now we may take up the above points which were pressed by the Learned

    Counsel for the appellant, as follows.
</p>
<p id="p_51">       i.     Whether the appeal filed by the Appellant is within the period of
              limitation?
</p>
<p id="p_52">            The Appellant has filed Miscellaneous Application (for short MA) No.

     165/2013 for condonation of delay in filing the Appeal. The Appellant states

     that the EC dated 13.12.2012 was communicated to the Appellant on 28.12.2012

     by the Respondent No.3, NTPC along with covering letter dated 24.12.2012 and

     the Appeal was filed on 16/23.03.2013 with a delay as the Appellant was on

     complete bed rest after undergoing treatment in a hospital in Mumbai due to a

     gunshot injury. Therefore, the delay was neither deliberate nor intended.

</p><p id="p_53">               In reply to the M.A. the Respondent No. 3, NTPC stated that in addition

     to personally delivering a copy of the EC to the Appellant, the EC was

     advertised in two local newspapers on 18.12.2012. Inspite of that the Appellant

     has filed the appeal on 16/23 .03.2013 i.e. 93 days after the date of accord of EC,

     88 days after publication of notice regarding accord of EC in newspapers and 78

     days after the copy of EC was delivered to him. Therefore, the appeal is not

     maintainable and barred by limitation and deserves to be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_54">               Having considered the facts and the contents of the MA along with the

     supporting medical documents filed by the Appellant, we are inclined to accept

     the same as the respondent too not controverted the facts or disputed the medical

     records of the Appellant who reportedly got injured in a shooting incident and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                                               Page 16 of 39</span>
 had to undergo treatment for gunshot wounds as well as attend follow up

procedures till February, 2013 and despite the fact that notice was sent to him by

the Project Proponent, he was unable to travel to Delhi for filing this appeal. In

the facts and circumstances, we are inclined to allow the MA No. 165/2013 and

condone the delay.
</p>
<p id="p_55"> ii.   Whether non furnishing of information regarding the exact
       boundaries along with coordinates of the proposed project site in the
       draft EIA report and not making them available during the public
       hearing vitiates the whole process of appraisal and granting EC?

       The contention of the Appellant is that the location of the site is a critical

component in order to examine as to whether the proposed site is in conformity

with the 'siting criteria' and once the ToR states that the site locations and the

coordinates have to be given it is mandatory on the part of the Project Proponent

to disclose the same in the EIA report. The Project Proponent i.e. Respondent

No. 3 in their counter affidavit has accepted that at the time of the preparation of

Draft Report, exact boundaries of land under acquisition were still under

finalization in consultation with the State Government and hence, the location of

the project was indicated through a single point coordinate instead of the

coordinates of all the four corners. After the boundaries of the land, being under

acquisition, were finalized, the coordinates of all the four corners for Main Plant

and Township as well as ash pond were included in the final EIA Report dated

04.04.2012 submitted to MoEF. But the Appellant avers that the final EIA

Report is not before the public and therefore no opportunity has been provided

for the public to give their comments as to the location of the power plant and its

impact. It was also submitted that by looking at the coordinates provided by the

 Power Plants and wetlands are not mentioned in the chapter on baseline

environmental studies of 2011 EIA Report.
</p>
<p id="p_56">       The MoEF in their reply stated that it is not a pre-requisite that the land

required for the power project shall be in complete possession prior to appraisal

by the EAC and that while there cannot be a deviation in location of a thermal

power plant as stated in the final EIA Report, the EAC ensures that the site so

selected does not have potential adverse environmental impacts that cannot be

mitigated substantially.
</p>
<p id="p_57">       It may be a fact that acquisition of huge chunk of land for the project of

such magnitude is a difficult task and time consuming process and so also the

scrutiny and appraisal process. But as brought out by the Appellant the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board Vs. C.

Kenchappa &amp; others (Supra) directed that in future, before acquisition of land

for development works consequences and adverse impact of development on

environment must be properly comprehended and the lands be acquired for

development ensuring that they do not gravely impair the ecology and

environment. The necessity of conducting EIA study, including it in the DEIAR

and placing it before the public during public hearing as the very basis of EIA

study is on the location of the project and its surroundings.

</p><p id="p_58">       However, in the present case though it is a fact that after acquisition of

total land and after knowing the exact boundaries, final EIA report was prepared

and submitted to MoEF and it was placed before the EAC which examined it and

recommended the grant of EC, the point that it was not part of the DEIAR and

not placed before public still remains and it is a deviation from the procedure. In

the present case the single point coordinate alone was given as the land

acquisition procedure has not been finalised by the Government. Based on the

single point coordinate the public hearing was held at Mahloi and was attended

by a large number of persons who did not raise any grievance of absence of this

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                        Page 18 of 39</span>
 information.     The affected persons appeared and only raised issues of

rehabilitation etc. The fact also remains that the final EIA Report does not

indicate location of any such critical sites as stated supra and does not involve

any potential adverse environmental impacts. Therefore, considering that it as an

important infrastructural project for power generation by a Public Sector

Undertaking and no motive can be attributed, some amount of flexibility is

required to be given more particularly when substantial progress has already

been made in the construction of the project.          Certain amount of marginal

variation is also required to be given keeping in view of the nature of the project,

its location, economic development of the Nation albeit without allowing blatant

environmental and ecological deviations, particularly when the interest of the

affected persons has been taken care of.
</p>
<p id="p_59">       Therefore issue No. 2 is decided against the Appellant and we hold that in

the facts and circumstances of the present case non-providing of the coordinates

in the DEIAR was neither deliberate nor motivated by any malafides and as such

it does not vitiate the whole process of appraisal and grant of EC particularly

when the same was provided in the final Environment Impact Assessment

Report which was considered by the MoEF and the impact of development on

environment has been taken care of and examined and no adverse impact found

so as not to grant clearance, but precautionary measures by way of conditions

were imposed while granting the EC.
</p>
<p id="p_60">iii.   Whether there is any concealment/suppression or misrepresentation
       of facts on the land acquired, its nature and category for the
       establishment of the project?
</p>
<p id="p_61">       According to the Appellant in the final EIA Report in the section with

respect to social impact it is stated that the total land area proposed for the site is

2859 acres comprising barren and single crop agriculture land. However, it is

only in the counter affidavit filed by the Respondent that the real break up of

land is given. It is specifically stated in the counter affidavit that out of 944.608

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                                            Page 19 of 39</span>
 hectares of private land, 681.604 hectares is of single crop and 263.004 hectares

of double crop agricultural land. Thus out of the total area involved so far as

private land is concerned 23% is double crop agricultural land and 59% is single

crop agricultural land. The Appellant further states that the siting criteria of the

MoEF clearly prohibits the use of prime agricultural land for setting up of

thermal power plants and NTPC made a false statement both in Form I and in

the Draft and final EIA Report that the land was barren and single crop. It was

neither part of the discussion nor formed part of the project description so far as

the EAC meeting is concerned nor it is mentioned in the EC. Thus this amounts

to deliberate concealment of information which is material to scoping, public

consultation and appraisal. The EAC has rejected thermal power plants which

are located in double crop agricultural land in the past.          Had the Project

Proponent disclosed the existence of the same, it would have rejected the present

proposal also.
</p>
<p id="p_62">       However, the Respondent NTPC states that at the time of preparation of

DEIAR, exact boundaries for land under acquisition were still under finalization

in consultation with State Government. Hence, it was not possible to give a

detailed break-up of the land in DEIAR. However, the same was presented

before EAC during its 56th meeting held on 04.09.2012. The detailed break-up

of land being acquired for the project is as follows:
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">      Type of Land              Area involved               % Area involved
Pvt. Land                    944.608 ha.                82% of total land
       (Single Crop Land            (681.604 ha.              (59% of Total land
       Double Crop Land)            263.004 ha)               23% of Total land)
Govt. Land                   60. 296 ha.                5% of Total land

</pre><p id="p_63">       The EIA in its 50th meeting held on 25th and 26th June, 2012 sought many

additional information from the Project Proponent apart from examining the

proposals submitted by the Project Proponent in compliance of the prescribed


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                                          Page 20 of 39</span>
 TOR. Accordingly the Project Proponent submitted further information

clarifying the issues raised by the EAC in its 50th meeting.

</p><p id="p_64">       Subsequently, in the 56th EAC meeting dated 3rd &amp; 4th September, 2012

further information was called by the EAC from the Project Proponent in

compliance of which the Project Proponent vide their letter dated 10th Sept, 2012

furnished the information including all the details of cultivable land involved in

the project. The Project Proponent has enclosed a copy of the letter dated

13.06.2011 of Chief General Manager, District Trade &amp; Industries Centre,

Raigarh, Chhattisgarh addressed to the Commissioner of Industries, Chhattisgarh

enclosing the details of joint inspection carried out by the officials of the

Industries Centre along with the officials of the Revenue Department on

02.06.2011 in the 9 villages where the land for project was acquired. The joint

inspection report clearly gives details of private land proposed for acquisition

measuring 944.608 hectares constituting approximately 681.604 hectares of

single crop land and approximately 263.004 hectares of double crop land.

</p><p id="p_65">       Therefore, it is clear that the MoEF before granting the EC dated

13.12.2012 was aware of the land requirement including that of all the crop lands

acquired from the farmers and sought all necessary information. It cannot,

therefore be held that the Project Proponent had concealed or misrepresented

about the acquisition of agricultural land for establishing the project. Even in the

final EIA report submitted by the Project Proponent the land use pattern of the

study area was also furnished as soon as the acquisition details were finalized

and made available by the concerned authorities of the State.            Details of

agricultural land and forest land were included as also the fact that several

clarifications were sought from the Project Proponent by the EAC in this regard

and necessary inputs were provided before the EC was granted.

</p><p id="p_66">       We may only point out that this issue of land acquisition came out once

the information was submitted by way of reply to the appeal by the respondent.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                         Page 21 of 39</span>
 Had it been the intention to suppress the same there was no reason for the

respondents to disclose the same and no issue to this effect could have been

raised by the Appellant. These are thus issues of afterthought raised during the

hearing of appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_67"> iv.   Whether acquiring the total land in the beginning itself for the
       ultimate capacity of the project i.e. 5x800 MW is in consonance with
       the prescribed norms when the project itself has been revised to be
       executed in 2 stages with stage-I getting EC for installation of 2x800
       MW units and in such case, the land acquisition for the entire
       ultimate capacity of 5x800 MW is permissible?
</p>
<p id="p_68">       According to the Appellant's version, contrary to the direction of the

MoEF, the project was not assessed for its ultimate capacity of 5x800 MW but

rather for its first stage of 2x800 MW. The Project Proponent contends that it is

a general practice to acquire the land for the entire project while feasibility

reports are prepared in stages as and when the other resources are available.

This is done to avoid the subsequent stages becoming unviable due to other

major projects coming up in adjacent area and preventing further acquisition of

adjoining land for later stages of concerned project as well as more importantly

cost escalation due to increase in land prices at a later point of time.

</p><p id="p_69">       We are of the view that in the facts and circumstances of this case looking

to the original capacity as proposed of 5x800 MW generation and having

confined the first stage to 2x800 MW it cannot be held that the land requirement

should have been restricted for 2x800 MW capacity alone. We do not in the

present case in the absence of any material before us to suggest that the

acquisition of land by NTPC, a Public Sector Undertaking of the Govt. of India

of such large tracts of land was actuated by any ulterior motive so as to call for

interference in this matter.

<p id="p_70"> v.    Whether the averments made by the Appellant on non-finalization
       and non inclusion of R&amp;R plan both in draft as well as in final EIA
       report and not placing it before the public during public hearing
       violates the EIA Notification 2006?

        It is the contention of the Appellant that as per the ToR issued by the

MoEF detailed R&amp;R plan shall be prepared taking into account the socio

economic status of the area, homestead oustees, land labourers. But the EIA

report has only stated that the "Details will be included after completion of Socio

Economic Survey." Thus, it is clear that the EIA report has failed to address the

very vital issue of R&amp;R which was mandatorily required under EIA Notification,

2006. The Appellant further submits that the R&amp;R is an integral component of

the EIA Notification, 2006 and all details with respect to the same are to be the

part of the draft EIA Report. It is further submitted by the Appellant that in case

the Project Proponent wanted to delink the R&amp;R component from the EC

process the same should have been brought to the notice of EAC and MoEF. In

its reply the Project Proponent has stated that the project specific details of exact

no. of Project Affected Persons (for short PAPs) due to land acquisition and

details of compensation and R&amp;R benefits etc. are not necessarily available at

the time of public hearing and environmental appraisal. The Project Proponent

pleads that the processes of EC and formulation of R&amp;R plan are two

independent activities.    R&amp;R plan is consequent to the process of land

acquisition and is formulated with the National Policy on R&amp;R issued by the

Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India. It is further replied that

while EIA Report covers the demographic and socio-economic aspects of

population within the study area of 10 Kms radius, the project specific details of

exact number of PAPs due to land acquisition and details of compensation and

R&amp;R benefits are not necessarily available at the time of public hearing.

</p><p id="p_72">       Perusal of the ToR item No. (xxviii) indicates that detailed R&amp;R plan is

required to be prepared by the Project Proponent taking into account the socio-

economic status of the area, homestead oustees, land oustees and landless

labourers. But there is no specific reference that R&amp;R plan shall be placed before

the public during public hearing.

</p><p id="p_74">        Learned counsel for the Appellant relied upon the decision of the

Principal Bench of this Tribunal in the case of M. P. Patil (supra), relating to

NTPC Kudgi Super Thermal Power Project in Bijapur District of Karnataka,

wherein despite taking note of the R&amp;R policy framed by the Ministry of Rural

Development, Government of India in the year 2007 and the R&amp;R policy

prepared by the NTPC in June, 2010 the importance of the requirement of

having an R&amp;R policy was stressed and emphasis was laid on furnishing of

specific details in the draft EIA report as well as in the Environment Impact

Assessment Report.
</p>
<p id="p_75">       We have considered the aforesaid submissions. However, in the present

case there are certain salient features which have to be taken note of.          In

Annexure -A9, the objections which were filed by the Jan Chetna Organization

of which the present Appellant Ramesh Agarwal claims to be an active member

and which filed objections on 23rd December, 2011, there is no objection with

regard to the Project Proponent not having provided the information regarding

the R&amp;R activity or programme with reference to the PAPs. Even in the original

appeal which was filed on 16th/23rd March, 2013 no challenge to the EC has been

raised on account of non-furnishing of the R&amp;R plan by the Project Proponent in

any specific terms other than submitting that the draft EIA report was silent on

this issue, which at best is a general and passing reference

       Be that as it may. From the reply of the Respondents and the documents

annexed thereto it is clearly spelt out as to why the R&amp;R and details thereof

could not be included in the draft EIA report as in fact the details of the PAPs as

also the area to be affected was not finalized and land acquisition proceedings

were not completed. Therefore, in our view, statement of the Project Proponent

in the draft EIA report that the R&amp;R plan shall be submitted separately and shall

be prepared taking into account the socio-economic status of the area, homestead

oustees, land oustees, landless labourers etc. is justified and in fact the same was

 duly included in the final EIA report submitted by the NTPC in March, 2012

itself before the grant of EC. Later, in compliance of the minutes of the 50th

EAC meeting dated 26.06.2012 the Respondent NTPC submitted final R&amp;R plan

to MoEF on 24.08.2012 and the same was considered by EAC during its 56th

meeting held on 04.09.2012. Nevertheless, it is clear that final EIA Report was

prepared in March 2012 without including the detailed/final R&amp;R plan.

However, the final R&amp;R plan was put-up in the 56th meeting of EAC and after

examining the plan, EAC recommended for grant of EC based on the details of

activities proposed under R&amp;R.
</p>
<p id="p_76">      Having said so it may also be stated that the Respondent NTPC placed on

record details of the R&amp;R works which had been initiated right from the year

2011-12 in accordance with the guidelines framed by the Ministry of Rural

Development, Govt. of India and the R&amp;R policy prepared by the NTPC itself in

June, 2012. The documents and report prepared by the NTPC in February, 2014

spells out the works which were undertaken in the year 2011-12 and specifically

completed as also the works which have been subsequently undertaken in the

year 2012-13 and 2013-14. As per the aforesaid information R&amp;R and CSR

activities were commenced right from the year 2011-12 even before the

preparation and finalization of the R&amp;R plan, in consultation with State

government officials and some of the issues which were raised during the public

hearing were taken note of and works initiated by the Project Proponent as per

the details given in the said documents. These included not only community

works but also economic activities undertaken by the cooperative societies of the

PAPs and individual works awarded to the individual PAPs. The fears which

were expressed in the case of NTPC Kudgi power plant judgment (supra) that

R&amp;R claims and plans should take into consideration the hardships being faced

by the persons who are likely to be displaced or adversely affected and specific

measures should be taken with reference to such persons and included in the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                                       Page 25 of 39</span>
 R&amp;R claims, we are of the opinion that the present case on the basis of the

information provided by the Respondents by way of their report of February,

2014 as also the commitment under the final EIA report as well as in the draft

EIA report along with the policy of the NTPC framed in June, 2010 for all the

NTPC projects leaves no room for doubt that the process of grant of EC has

been vitiated as a result of non-furnishing of the detailed R&amp;R plan by the

Project Proponent during public hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_77">       We are therefore, unable to accept the aforesaid contention of the

Appellant that failure on the part of the Project Proponent of not having finalised

and not included the R&amp;R plan in the draft as well as in the final EIA report

vitiates the EC so as to violate the provision of the EIA Notification, 2006.

</p><p id="p_78">       That apart, even as per the case of the Appellant, as submitted, was that it

was permissible for the Project Proponent to have sought delinking of the R&amp;R

process from the EC process but the same was not sought.            This, in itself

suggests that the two can be delinked and examined separately. The R&amp;R

component is also linked to the acquisition of land and adverse effect it may

have on the PAPs. This leads us to further issues of not having provided the four

coordinates and not provided the full information about the nature of land to be

acquired etc. Thus, the three issues are interlinked and if it is permissible for

delinking the R&amp;R from EC process then surely it cannot be a material defect by

not providing this information in detail in the DEIAR so as to affect the grant of

EC after final assessment when these issues have been considered before grant

of EC even though information was not supplied in the DEIAR by the Project

Proponent.
</p>
<p id="p_79">       We are therefore of the view that any deficiency in the DEIAR with

regard to R&amp;R will not affect or result in the total cancellation of the EC when in

the present case R&amp;R plans have been submitted before grant of EC and made

 part of EC condition and being executed by the Project Proponent in terms of the

EC conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_80"> vi.   Whether the appraisal of the project is based on outdated data and
       wrong and incomplete EIA study and lack of detailed scrutiny and
       failure to discuss on the Cumulative Impact Assessment by the EAC,
       as alleged by the Appellant, vitiates the process of granting the EC?

       As already brought out (supra) the contention of the Appellant is that the

EIA Report is prepared on the basis of outdated data collected for the period

from December, 2006 to November, 2007. Even though, the Project Proponent

justified the same by stating that one season data of pre-monsoon period of 2011

has been included in the Final Report submitted to MoEF as the DEIAR was

submitted at the initial stage in 2007, the public were not aware of the latest data

collected during pre-monsoon season of 2011 as the same was not available at

the time of public hearing conducted on 23.12.2011. The Project Proponent

justifies that only one season data (except monsoon season) is required for EIA

study of thermal power projects as per the Technical EIA Guidance manual for

Thermal Power Plants. Moreover, the thermal power plant is yet to come and

hence its contribution is not part of existing ambient air quality, whether it was

measured in 2006-07 or in 2011. It is only giving the background concentration.

It is the incremental ground level concentration, which is more important for

ambient air quality of the area after the thermal power plant is established and

operated.

<p id="p_81">       We are of the view that as submitted by the Learned Counsel for the

Project Proponent that due to installation of high efficiency Electrostatic

Precipitators the emission of particulate matter shall be limited to 50 mg/Nm3

and the incremental ground level of the particulate matter due to operation of the

stage-I of 2 x 800 MW of the project shall be order of 1.03µg/m3. Therefore

there is no possibility of exceeding the standards prescribed under National

 Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by the Project Proponent and as such

no interference is called for by this Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_82">       Further, it is clear that cumulative impact of the existing and proposed

projects within the area was undertaken separately and submitted by the Project

Proponent to MoEF vide letter dated 24.8.2012 and the same was considered by

the EAC in its 56th meeting held on 4.9.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_83">       With regard to the averments made by the Appellant pointing out the

deficiencies at the appraisal stage by the EAC it is clear from the record placed

before us that the EAC has apprised the project with updated data on air, noise,

meteorological and water quality collected for pre-monsoon season of 2011 as

mentioned in the final EIA report submitted by the Project Proponent to the

Respondent No. 1/ MoEF vide its letter dated 3rd April, 2011 and therefore no

interference is called for by this Tribunal .

<p id="p_84">
vii.   Does the EIA Report take into account the emission from sources
       other than stack emission and also does it take into account the
       impact due to transmission line?
</p>
<p id="p_85">       It is the case of the Appellant that the EIA has to take into account the

impact due to both non-stack emissions (fugitive emissions) as well as

transmission lines. But this is not done in this project. The Appellant further

states that the EIA Report is silent on the layout of transmission system, land

requirement and its type and it is also not clear whether the land required for

transmission line is free of encumbrances. The Project Proponent denied that the

impact analysis on ambient air was incomplete and indirect contributions of the

project as stated in the appeal cannot be taken into account in such analysis. Here

it is important to mention that the fugitive emissions are relevant in industries

where process emissions are significant source of air pollution. In thermal power

plants, there is no process emission. The emission is mainly due to burning of

coal. The fugitive emissions or non-stack emissions are only due to coal



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                                        Page 28 of 39</span>
 handling, which is taken care of by dust suppression measures adopted including

sprinkling of water on coal during handling. The Technical EIA Guidance

Manual for Thermal Power Plants states that the cumulative impacts due to

induced development or their level or even secondary indirect impacts are

difficult to be quantified and because of higher level of uncertainties, these

impacts cannot normally be assessed over a long time of horizon. Further, the

guidelines for conducting Air Quality Modeling for Assessment of impacts to

Air Environment published by Central Pollution Control Board (for short CPCB)

also considers the impacts due to stack emissions only. Therefore, the impact

analysis on ambient air was in accordance with the relevant manuals and

guidelines and as per the prevailing practice for EIA studies for Thermal Power

Projects.
</p>
<p id="p_86">       Respondent NTPC has clearly stated that it has already adopted an

emission limit of 50 mg/Nm3 for the project, which is much below the National

Standards of 150 mg/Nm3 for Thermal Power Plants with generation capacity of

210 MW and above, notified under Schedule-I of Environment (Protection)

Rules, 1986 at serial number 25. With regard to the allegation of the appellant

that EIA Report provided incomplete impact analysis of NAAQS, the Project

Proponent states that the indirect contributions of the project cannot be taken

into account in such analysis and Technical EIA Guidance Manual for Thermal

Power Plants 2010 states that "the cumulative impacts due to induced

development or third level or even secondary indirect impacts are difficult to be

quantified. Because of higher levels of uncertainties these impacts cannot

normally be assessed for a long time horizon." Moreover the guidelines for

conducting air quality modeling for assessment of impacts to air environment

published by CPCB also considers the impacts due to stack emissions only as

this is the main source of air pollution and other indirect sources are not

</p><p id="p_88">        The Project Proponent further stated that the coal handling areas where

the coal is unloaded from the railway wagons as well as coal yards are provided

with dust suppression system having water sprinklers to minimize emission of

dust and conveyer belt carrying coal from unloading area to coal stock yards and

all the transfer points are also covered and have the provisions for dust

suppression systems. Apart from the above, green belt is proposed to act as

wind breaks and further prevent emissions of fugitive dust.

</p><p id="p_89">       Likewise, ash handling will be done to prevent pollution. Fly ash is

extracted from flu gas through high efficiency Electrostatic Precipitators. Ash is

taken from Electrostatic Hoppers in dry from and transported to ash storage silos

using pneumatic conveying system through closed pipelines so that there are no

chances of fugitive emissions. Storage silos are provided with bag fitters to

prevent fugitive dust emission.
</p>
<p id="p_90">       All the above precautions have been highlighted in the minutes of the

EAC meeting and form part of EC conditions. Further, the Project Proponent has

undertaken that fugitive emissions due to vehicular movement are controlled

through paving of all roads within the plant area and its vicinity as well as proper

maintenance of vehicles. The final EIA Report also gives the particulars of

impact of fugitive emissions from various sources and measures to be taken to

control them.
</p>
<p id="p_91">       With regard to perceived impact of transmission line to be laid, though it

is not a part of ToR, the Technical EIA Guidance Manual for Thermal Power

Plants states that the major component of Thermal Power Plants includes the

power system i.e. power source turbine and generator and associated facilities

which may include the electrical substation and transmission line which will

determine the nature and intensity of environmental impact. The Respondent No.

3 NTPC avers that the Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (for short PGCIL) is

the concerned authority to develop the transmission and distribution system and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                                         Page 30 of 39</span>
 in this regard PGCIL to take necessary clearance. Therefore, the answer to the

point No. vii is in affirmative and no interference is called for by this Tribunal

viii.   Whether the water requirement for the project and the cumulative
        impact of the project on river Mahanadi has been studied and it
        fulfills the environmental norms?
</p>
<p id="p_92">        The Appellant has highlighted the impact on river Mahanadi in the

Appeal and expressed his apprehensions whether river Mahanadi will be able to

meet the water requirement of various power projects including the project of the

Respondent NTPC and other activities on its course. As per the ToR data on

source of water and its availability and territorial and river ecology has to be

collected. The EIA report details the surface water quality and the Project

Proponent stated that the backwaters of Hirakund Reservoir on river Mahanadi

existing within 10 km. of the project are not having any ecologically sensitive

wetlands and the notification on the Wetlands (Conservation &amp; Management)

Rules, 2010 are not violated in this case and both the Central and State Water

Commissions have undertaken detailed study on the availability of water in

Mahanadi before according the water commitment to the project and only the

surplus water flowing in the river during the monsoon period will be tapped by

constructing a barrage and utilized for the project.        Thus we find that on

consideration of the relevant material the appraisals have been made and no

exception can be taken to the same.
</p>
<p id="p_93"> ix.    Whether the issues raised during the public hearing have been
        addressed and taken into consideration while finalizing the EIA
        report based on which EAC appraised the project and MoEF granted
        the EC?
</p>
<p id="p_94">
        The Appellant has contended that the public was not informed about the

true impact of the project. However, the Respondent NTPC in its reply has

averred that questions raised by the public and NTPC's response were recorded

and submitted to the EAC and they find place in the final EIA report. They also




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                                                          Page 31 of 39</span>
 argued that the objections raised by the public were due to lack of understanding

of the issues by the public rather than the deficiency in the EIA report.

</p><p id="p_95">       On perusal of the written submissions of the Appellant listing the issues

raised during the public hearing and NTPC's response, which are furnished in a

tabular form, we are of the opinion that the questions were recorded and

answered by the Respondent NTPC which as per the Appellant are not to his

satisfaction. Nonetheless, all were answered and response recorded and the EAC

was the authority that needs to scrutinise the validity of the NTPC's response

which it has done in the meeting. Therefore the contention of the Appellant is

not well founded.
</p>
<p id="p_96"> x.    Whether the contention of the Appellant that the EIA study does not
       include information on significant pollutants emitted due to
       establishment of the power plant in question, is correct?

       The major concern expressed by the Appellant is with regard to the effect

of radioactivity from the coal ash, emission of VOCs and other pollutants such

as Lead, Carbon Monoxide, Ammonia, Benzene, Benzo(o)Pyrene, Arsenic,

Nickel etc. With regard to effect of nuclear radiation from the coal powered

Thermal Power Plants the Project Proponent states that there are no standards for

radioactivity from coal ash.     The monitoring and regulation of presence of

radioactive materials comes under <a href="/doc/715059/" id="a_4">Atomic Energy Act</a>, 1962 and is being

regulated by Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India, which is

beyond the purview of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and

also NGT Act, 2010. The relevant section under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 is reproduced hereunder:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">       <a href="/doc/31553410/" id="a_7">Section 52</a>. Effect of other Laws: Save as otherwise provided by
       or under the <a href="/doc/715059/" id="a_8">Atomic Energy Act</a>, 1962 (33 of 1962), in relation to
       radioactive air pollution the provision of this Act shall have effect
       notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any
       enactment other than this Act.</blockquote><p id="p_97">

</p><p id="p_98">       As stated himself by the Appellant in his Appeal No. 07/2011 in <a href="/doc/11961914/" id="a_9">Krishi

Vigyan Arogya Sansthan vs. MoEF</a>, this Tribunal has agreed that no such

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                                                            Page 32 of 39</span>
 standards are prescribed with regard to nuclear radiation from the coal fired

Thermal Power Plants and therefore the MoEF was directed to initiate long term

study with reference to coal ash generated by the Thermal Power Plants.

Accordingly, the Respondent No.1 has written to the Department of Atomic

Energy, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and CPCB on 24.05.2012 for

formulation of standards for level of radiation from coal based Thermal Power

Plants and the Department of Atomic Energy has constituted a task group review

the matter and make necessary recommendations. Thus, it was not possible for

EAC to make any reference on possible nuclear radioactivity level of the coal

used for the proposed Thermal Power Plant. Therefore, the contention of the

Appellant that the EAC neither made any reference nor sought any information

from the Project Proponent with respect to the possible radioactivity levels, is

not sustainable as EAC being aware that no such standards are prescribed.

</p><p id="p_99">       With regard to VOCs and other pollutants stated above, the Project

Proponent in the draft EIA report has stated that NTPC had undertaken fresh

environmental monitoring for pre monsoon season of 2011 in all the 4

monitoring locations and noted that the monitored base line values are far below

NAAQ standards with respect to Suspended Particulate Matter, Respirable

Particulate Matter, Sulphur Dioxide, Oxides of Nitrogen, Mercury and Ozone.

As stated by the Appellant study on the rest of the aforesaid pollutants is not

done and included in the EIA report and it is a fact that there is no mention about

these pollutants in the EIA report. ToR dated 01.08.2007 prescribed in this case

relating to AAQ data, are reproduced below:
</p>
<p id="p_100">       xii    One season data (except monsoon) to be given
       xiii   Impact of the project on the AAQ of the area, details of the
              model used and the input data used for modelling should also
              be provided.
</p>
<p id="p_101">
        At the time of collection of environmental data from December, 2006 to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                                                        Page 33 of 39</span>
       November, 2007 NAAQS notified by the CPCB does not include Benzene,

      Benzo(o) Pyrene, Arsenic and Nickel. These pollutants were included in

      NAAQS in 2009 notification. With regard to VOCs, they were never a part of

      NAAQ Standards notified by the CPCB. Normally, the impact on ambient air

      quality is studied for the parameters which are prescribed for regulating

      emissions from thermal power plants. In the EIA Manual or the Standards

      notified under Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, these parameters are not

      prescribed as regulating parameters for the monitoring and regulation. In such

      situation monitoring of these parameters in ambient air quality before the

      industry is established, will not in any manner help assessing its impact. If at all

      such pollutants are detected in the ambient air quality, they might be present due

      to some other sources. If such parameters are not regulatory parameters for the

      thermal power plants, such monitoring will not provide any information on

      impact of thermal power plants on ambient air quality. However, as per specific

      condition no. (v) of EC a long term study on radio-activity and heavy metals

      contents has to be done by the Project Proponent. Thus taking into account of

      the overall impact of the project and since sufficient safeguards have been

      incorporated in the conditions while granting the EC and regular monitoring of

      pollutants is a necessity once the project comes into being the apprehension

      expressed by the Appellant is not significant enough to take into account when

      considered with the overall process of EIA preparation, appraisal and grant of

      EC.
</p>
<p id="p_102">28. Lastly, it has been submitted by the Appellant that the EAC ought to have given

     reasons for acceptance or rejection. We find from the material on record that at

     several stages of the appraisal various queries were raised and further information

     was sought from the Project Proponent. This is evident from the Minutes of the

     Meetings of the EAC. After each such meeting the NTPC has submitted its

     response with supporting material and documents which came to be placed before

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                                                               Page 34 of 39</span>
      the EAC in the subsequent meetings where it is recorded that various material

     received from the Project Proponent was placed before the members for

     consideration and on having considered the same the Committee was satisfied and

     recommended that the EC may be granted.
</p>
<p id="p_103">29. Learned Counsel argued at length that this was not in accordance with the law as

     laid down in various judgements regarding appreciation of the material, it

     consideration and requirement to give reasons. We have given out thoughtful

     consideration to the above submission and the judgements relied upon by the

     Learned Counsel for the Appellant. While there can be no quarrel with the general

     proposition of recording the facts and circumstances of the present case, the

     procedure for appraisal has been prescribed under the Environment Clearance

     Regulations, 2006 itself in detail along with the format prescribed under Appendix

     V in which the order is required to be passed. Unfortunately, in the cases cited

     before us this aspect has not at all been cited.

</p><p id="p_114">31. The Scheme of appraisal quoted above clearly goes to show that under para IV

    Stage (4) Sub para (i) while carrying out appraisal the Expert may seek to clarify

    any doubts by inviting the Project Proponent if any clarification is required. The

    necessity is only in the event of any doubts requiring clarification from the Project

    Proponent and not any other person. On conclusion of these proceedings the EAC

    or SEAC concerned shall make their recommendations to the regulatory authority

    either for grant of prior EC on terms and conditions or for rejection of the

    application for prior EC. In our view the words "together with reasons for the

    same" only refer to reasons for rejection. This is clear from a perusal of sub-para

</p><p id="p_115">    (iii) of Para IV. Stage (4) under which it is provided that "the prescribed

    procedure for appraisal is given in Appendix V". A perusal of Appendix V para 6

    quoted above only requires that in the case of favourable recommendation for

    grant of EC "the minutes shall clearly list out the specific environmental

    safeguards and conditions" as opposed to giving any reason for acceptance of the

    application. It further provides that it is only "in case the recommendations are

    for rejection, the reasons for the same shall also be explicitly stated."


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                                                Page 37 of 39</span>
</p><p id="p_116"> 32. Unfortunately while deciding some of the cases the above statutory provision and

     requirement of giving reasons only in the case of rejection as opposed to reasons

     for giving a favourable recommendation with specific environmental safeguards

     and conditions, was not cited and thus the judgements came to be delivered on the

     basis of general principles of administrative law.      When there is a specific

     provision and a format is prescribed under the law dealing the special subject the

     special law shall override the general law and no fault can be found if the

     recommendations for grant of EC by the EAC in favour of the Project Proponent

     when made without elaborating the same in the order for acceptance. The law has

     taken care to provide remedy to any person aggrieved in the form of filing an

     appeal against the grant of EC which the Appellant has done in the present case

     and on a consideration of the issues raised in the appeal, we do not find any

     substance in any of the objections raised before us so as to warrant interference

     even assuming the reasons ought to have been recorded for the benefit of any

     objector or member of general public.
</p>
<p id="p_117">33. The entire scope of the operation and implementation of the Environmental Laws

     takes care to see that all possible aspects are analysed before the permissions are

     granted. The EC when granted takes care of putting various conditions which

     must at all times be observed by the Project Proponent. Implementation of such

     conditions is mandatory and continuous monitoring of emissions and discharge

     under Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and Water (Prevention

     and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 is mandatory and non-compliance can result

     in withholding of consents under the aforesaid acts which are to be given on

     inspection.   The PAPs can also in the event of non-implementation of R&amp;R

     measures or CSR measures approach for their implementation and seek additional

     measures if required in the interest of general public. Thus, in the present case we




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                                               Page 38 of 39</span>
      do not find from the issues raised that grievances of the appellant are such so as to

     call for interference as discussed above.
</p>
<p id="p_118">34. We accordingly hold that the EC granted based on such recommendation of the

     EAC in accordance with Para IV. Stage (4), Sub-para (iii) and as per procedure

     prescribed for Appraisal in Appendix V cannot be found fault with. Having said

     so we may add that the objections which were raised by the Appellant are the

     same as those which have been raised in this appeal which we have already dealt

     with above and we have found no merit in the same. As such we find no merit in

     the submission and the same is accordingly rejected.

<p id="p_119">35. As a result of our above discussion, we are of the opinion that the grant of EC to

     the NTPC Respondent No. 3 vide letter dated 31.12.2012 does not call for any
