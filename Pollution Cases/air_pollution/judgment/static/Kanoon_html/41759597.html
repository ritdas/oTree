     THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226 AND
227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO QUASH THE
ORDER AT ANNEXURE-C DATED 02.11.2012, ISSUED/ PASSED BY
THE COMMITTEE HEADED BY R2.

     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR HEARING ON
INTERLOCUTORY APPLICATIONS THIS DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE MADE
THE FOLLOWING:
                               -7-


                            ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">D.H.WAGHELA, C.J. (Oral) :
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">1.    The petition is filed as public interest litigation against

illegal operation of stone crusher units in and around village:

Kolhar, Basavan Bagewadi Taluk, Vijayapura District.        It is

alleged that the stone crusher units were established and

working in contravention of the provisions of Section 6 of the

Karnataka Regulation of Stone Crushers Act, 2011 ('Act' for

short). It is further alleged that, on account of declaration of

certain areas as 'safer zones' under the said Act, some of the

crusher units were claiming to be operating in safer zones

although such zone was within a distance of 500 meters of

Kolhar village and 250 meters from the National Highway.

The challenge to declaration of safer zones vide proceedings of

District Level Stone Crushing Control Committee held on

02.11.2012 is not substantiated by any relevant evidence.


</p><p id="p_4">2.    It was, however, found during the course of hearing

that, not only respondent Nos.7 to 14 herein, but few other

stone crushing units were operating in the area without

consent or without fulfilling the requisite conditions under the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  -8-</span>


provisions of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1981 ('<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air Act</a>' for short).          And, on account of series of

violations, orders in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Section 31A</a> of

the Air Act have been issued to forthwith close down the

operation of such stone crushers.            In some cases, detailed

orders are made by the Karnataka State Pollution Control

Board to not only close down the stone crusher units

forthwith, but orders have been issued to the Deputy

Commissioner of the District to seize such stone crusher units

and the Managing Director of Hubli Electricity Supply Company

(HESCOM) is also directed to stop power supply to such units.

By such orders issued in July 2014, the Chief Electrical

Inspector   in   the   office   of   Chief   Electrical   Inspectorate,

Bengaluru is directed to stop the operation of diesel generator

sets immediately and until further orders.


</p><p id="p_5">3.   Learned counsel for the petitioners has alleged, on the

basis of sketchy affidavits of some of the petitioners that the

stone crusher units have been operating even after such

orders of State Pollution Control Board and no further

preventive actions were taken by the authorities to whom the

directions were issued under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>. By placing on record
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 -9-</span>


a number of photographs, it is contended on behalf of stone

crusher units joined herein as respondent Nos.7 to 14 that,

the industrial units have actually closed their operations and

the plants are lying idle without the diesel generator sets

being reconnected to even temporarily run the industrial units.

It is contended on their behalf that such units under the

orders of closure proposed to comply with the conditions

which may be imposed by the State Pollution Control Board

and obtain valid consent for the purpose of running the units

in a legal manner. However, due to pendency of the petition,

State    Pollution   Control   Board   is   not   entertaining   their

applications, according to their submission.


</p><p id="p_6">4.      Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners insisted

that the offending units were still operating and causing air

pollution in the area which was obviously a hazardous for the

people, cattle and crops in the surrounding areas.                He,

however, relied upon certain photographs to substantiate his

allegation    that   the   units   were     operational,   but    the

photographs, prima facie, appeared to be showing operation

of quarries rather than stone crusher units.
</p><p id="p_7">                                - 10 -
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.      Under the above circumstances, a statement is made,

on instruction, by learned counsel Mr. Gururaj Joshi that the

State    Pollution Control Board will process any pending

application, in accordance with law, and unless and until

consent is accorded to the stone crusher units and all the

conditions   that   may   be    imposed   are   complied   with,

respondents and other stone crusher units in the area will not

be allowed to operate and cause any air pollution. He

submitted that the Environmental Engineer appointed in the

area will regularly visit the area of the units and, whether any

complaint is received from the citizens including any of the

petitioners or not, any unit operating in violation of law shall

be immediately arraigned as the accused in a criminal case by

filing appropriate complaint, in accordance with law. It is also

stated on behalf of respondent-crusher units that they will not

re-start operation of any of the crusher units unless and until

valid consent is granted by the State Pollution Control Board

and the stone crushers having the facility of diesel generator

sets will not only completely disconnect the diesel generator

sets, but allow inspection thereof by the Environmental

Engineer of the State Pollution Control Board as also by the
</p><p id="p_10">                              - 11 -
</p>
<p id="p_11">
Deputy Electrical Inspector to ensure that the diesel generator

sets cannot be put to even any temporary use or for any

clandestine operation of the stone crusher units. It is realised

that, it is absolutely necessary and in the interest of rule of

law that no stone crusher unit is allowed to operate in the

area except strictly in accordance with law and after providing

all the necessary equipments and safeguards for preventing

any health hazard or damage to the environment including

crops of the farmers tilling their land in the surrounding areas.

It would be the duty of the Tahsildar and the Deputy

Commissioner concerned to ensure that the area is kept free

of any air pollution or nuisance and the operation of any stone

crusher unit is strictly conforming to and abiding by the

conditions that may be imposed by the State Pollution Control

Board, if and when consent is granted for operation of such

units.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">6.       The parties having been satisfied with the above

directions and observations, the petition does not survive for

any further orders and accordingly, it is disposed, with liberty

to the petitioners to make appropriate complaint, in case of

necessity, to the local office of the State Pollution Control
</p><p id="p_14">                             - 12 -

<p id="p_15">
Board and to the Deputy Commissioner of the District. There

is no order as to cost.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      In view of disposal of the petition, all pending I.As do

not survive for consideration and are accordingly disposed.
