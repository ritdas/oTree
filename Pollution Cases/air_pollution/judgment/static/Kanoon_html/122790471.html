<p id="p_4">JUDGMENT BY THE BENCH



</p><p id="p_5">1.        Appellant is a company incorporated under the
     provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, 1956 and is engaged in
     the business of manufacturing and sale of carbonated soft
     drinks under the brand name of Coca-Cola Sprite, Limca,
     Mazza, Thmps Up etc. and has a plant at Raninagar
     Industrial Growth Centre, P.S. and District Jalpaiguri, West
     Bengal.
</p>


<p id="p_6">2.        The directions issued by West Bengal Pollution Control
     Board (WBPCB) to the Appellant Company by letter dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            3</span>


  2nd May, 2011 is sought to be assailed in this Appeal. By
  the said letter, WBPCB directed the Appellant Company as
  follows:
</p>

<p id="p_7">       "a) The industry shall ensure continuous and smooth
     functioning of the pollution abatement system in all its
     unit operations and comply with the environmental
     standards.
</p><p id="p_8">       b) The industry shall submit an action plan for
     compliance of liquid effluent discharge standard within a
     time period of fifteen (15) days. The industry shall also
     install suitable infrastructure for testing of the liquid
     effluent samples so as to assess the characteristics of
     the discharged effluent.
</p><p id="p_9">       c) The industry shall submit a Bank Guarantee
     (proforma enclosed) of Rs. 5,00,000/-(Rupees five lakhs)
     only, valid for twelve (12) months within fifteen (15) days
     from the date of issuance of this Direction as an
     assurance to comply with the above directions. "
</p>

<p id="p_10">       The directions are impugned mainly on the
following grounds:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "i) The WBPCB had no power / jurisdiction to impose
       pollution cost or direct the Appellant to furnish a Bank
       Guarantee as penal measure.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   4</span>


<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             ii) The Appellant's right of hearing was denied before
             issuance of the said directions, thus there was violation
             of principle of natural justice and equity.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             iii) The order is an after thought, and the same has no
             nexus with the last analysis report of the discharged
             effluent.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">             In the alternative it is contended that the procedure
     prescribed under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a> and Rules made
     there under were not followed by the WBPCB before imposing
     the fine/penalty.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     3.     To appreciate the inter-se controversy it would be just
      and proper to refer to some of the facts. The Appellant was
      granted consent under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_4">Section 25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_5">26</a> of the Water
      (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">(Water Act</a>)
      and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_8">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution)
      Act</a>, 1981 <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_10">(Air Act</a>) by the WBPCB, for operating, a
      manufacturing and bottling plant at Raninagar Industrial
      Growth Centre, Jalpaiguri, on 19th September, 2000. The said
      consent was extended time and again in consonance with the
      provisions of both Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_11">Air Act</a>.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_11">4.        On 5th August, 2010, the WBPCB issued a notice for
     collection of samples from the Appellant's plant. In consonance
     with said notice samples were collected by the officials of
     WBPCB from the premises of the Appellant's plant on 6th
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  5</span>


     August, 2010.      According to the Appellant the specific
     procedure stipulated under <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_12">Section 21</a> of the Water Act for
     collection of the samples were not followed, in as much as
     neither the samples were divided into two parts in the presence
     of the occupier or his agent of the Appellant nor they were
     sealed, nor the signature of the occupier or his agent was
     taken by the officers of WBPCB while collecting the samples.
</p>

<p id="p_12">     Another set of samples were also collected from the premises
     of the Appellant on 9th December, 2010. It is alleged, the said
     samples were also collected without following the mandatory
     procedure laid down in <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_13">Section 21</a> of the Water Act.
</p>

<p id="p_13">5.        On 16th December, 2010, WBPCB on the basis of the
     analysis report of the samples which were collected on 6th
     August, 2010, &amp; 9th December, 2010, issued a show-cause
     notice alleging violation of the regulatory standards, and called
     upon the Appellant to show-cause, and to take necessary
     steps to comply with the prescribed standards. The Appellant
     was also asked to inform the office, the action taken in that
     regard.   It is averred that necessary cause was shown by the
     Appellant, within the time prescribed indicating the measures
     taken for eradicating the deficiencies.       WBPCB, on 29th
     December, 2010 once again took samples from the Appellant's
     plant and got the same analyzed. The analysis report dated
     11th February, 2011 revealed that the samples collected on
     29th December, 2010 were within the prescribed parameters.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    6</span>


<p id="p_14">6.        While matter stood thus, on 14th February, 2011 the
     WBPCB     issued    another       notice   and   directed   personal
     appearance of the Appellant before the Board, at Kolkata. In
     compliance with the said notice the Factory Manager of the
     Appellant Company it is stated, appeared before the Board and
     advanced his submissions and contended that no violation of
     the specified standards are committed. The grievance of the
     Appellant is that without properly appreciating the fact that the
     effluents of the plant satisfy / meet the standards prescribed
     and that there is no violation, the WBPCB mechanically issued
     the impugned order dated 2nd May, 2011 in purported exercise
     of the power conferred upon it under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_14">Section 33</a> A of the Water
     Act, and as such the said order cannot be sustained in law.
</p>

<p id="p_15">7.        After receiving the notice from this Tribunal, the
     Respondents appeared and filed detailed counter affidavit
     repudiating the stand taken in different paragraphs of the
     memorandum of appeal.             It is contended that WBPCB is
     authorized to monitor statutory compliances of Industries
     operating in the State of West Bengal, with regard to different
     pollution Control Laws including Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_15">Air Act</a>, as well as
     the rules framed there under. In usual course of business,
     officers of WBPCB inspected the premises of the Appellant's
     Industry, after serving prior notice on 6th August, 2010 and 9th
     December, 2010. In course of such inspections, the officials
     collected samples of trade effluent in presence of competent
     representatives of the Appellant Industry.        It is emphatically
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   7</span>


     contended that the samples, which were collected on 6th
     August, 2010, and 5th October, 2010 were divided and kept in
     bottles as per law and they were duly sealed and signed in
     presence of the representatives of the Appellant concern.
     Analysis of the samples so collected revealed            that the
     Appellant industry was manufacturing its products in gross
     violation of the standards prescribed in the letter of "Consent to
     Operate" and consequently the Appellant was called upon to
     show-cause. After considering the cause shown, and on being
     satisfied that it is a fit case where necessary stringent
     directions should be issued, WBPCB directed the Appellant to
     pay pollution cost of Rs. 5,00,000/- (five lakhs) and also to
     submit a bank guarantee of Rs. 5,00,000/- (five lakhs) as an
     assurance to comply with the directions issued vide order
     dated 2nd May, 2011 in future. The action of the WBPCB, it is
     contended, was strictly in consonance with the provisions of
     the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_16">Air Act</a> and the submissions to the contrary are
     unfounded.
</p>

<p id="p_16">8.        The Appellant filed a rejoinder to the reply filed by the
     Respondent more or less reiterating the stands taken in the
     Memorandum of Appeal.            The Respondents also filed a
     counter to the Rejoinder, denying the allegations leveled
     therein and in the Memorandum of Appeal.
</p>

<p id="p_17">9.        Mr. Sibal, Learned Counsel appearing for the Appellants,
     in course of arguments, took the stand that WBPCB lacked the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                8</span>


  power to impose penalty in the form of substantial amounts or
  direct to submit Bank guarantee as an assurance to comply
  with the directions issued either, under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_17">Section 33A</a> or any
  other provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_18">Water Act</a>, 1974. According to Mr. Sibal
  a pecuniary liability for non-compliance with any legal
  obligations can be imposed only by clear, unambiguous and
  express provisions of an enactment. In the case in hand, as
  there is no such express and unambiguous provision in the
  <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_19">Water Act</a>, WBPCB was not authorized or empowered to
  impose any sort of penalty, thus the directions issued by the
  impugned order     are in excess of the jurisdiction conferred
  upon it and it is a fit case where the said order may be set
  aside.
</p>

<p id="p_18">10.     In support of his contentions, Mr. Sibal relied upon the
  decision of the Supreme Court in the case of M/s Khemka &amp;
  Co. (Agencies) Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Maharashtra (1975) 2
  SCC 22, and of High Court in the case of Splendor Landbase
  Ltd. Vs Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC)
  reported in 173 (2010) Delhi Law Times-52,


  Referring to <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_20">Section 25</a> of the Water Act, it is submitted that the
  said Section empowers the Board to impose binding conditions
  upon an Industry who seeks consent to operate. <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_21">Section 44</a>,
  according to Mr. Sibal stipulates that whoever contravenes the
  provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_22">Section 25</a> or <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_23">Section 26</a> shall be liable to be
  punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less
  than one year and six months but which may extend to 6 years
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                               9</span>


  and with fine.   Similarly, <a href="/doc/1330791/" id="a_24">Section 41</a> stipulates the penalty
  which can be imposed in the event of any failure to comply with
  the directions issued under <a href="/doc/1286098/" id="a_25">Section 20(2)</a> or <a href="/doc/303980/" id="a_26">Section 20</a> (3) or
  orders issued under <a href="/doc/140281/" id="a_27">Section 32</a> (1) (c) or directions issued
  under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_28">Section 33</a> (2) or <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_29">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act. Placing
  reliance on <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_30">Section 49</a> of the Water Act, it is submitted that
  only a Court which is not inferior to that of Metropolitan
  Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate is empowered to try any
  offence punishable under the Act on the basis of complaint
  made by the Board or any other person.       No doubt <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_31">Section
  33A</a> empowers the Board to give directions, but then the said
  directions have to be subject to the provisions of the Act. A
  cumulative reading of the different provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_32">Water Act</a>,
  it is contended, leads to an irresistible conclusion that only a
  Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate, has the power
  to impose penalty if the directions issued by the Board are
  contravened or violated. In view of the said clear position, it
  cannot be presumed that <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_33">Section 33A</a> over rides the provisions
  stipulated under <a href="/doc/1330791/" id="a_34">Section 41</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_35">44</a> and <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_36">49</a> of the Act. In other
  words, the Powers under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_37">Section 33A</a> is circumscribed by
  other Provisions of the Water Act


</p><p id="p_19">11.     The expression "any direction" in <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_38">Section 33A</a> according
  to Mr. Sibal cannot be extended to a stage which would make
  the provisions under <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_39">Section 49</a> and other Sections otiose. In
  support of his submissions Mr. Sibal relied upon the decision of
  the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Institute of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                              10</span>


  Chartered Accountants of India Vs. Price Waterhouse
  (1997) 6 SCC 312 and the decision in the case of Union of
  India Vs Azadi Bachao Andolan and another (2004) 10 SCC
</p><p id="p_20">  1.


</p><p id="p_21">12.    Questioning the propriety of the WBPCB, with regard to
  the directions to submit Bank guarantee of Rs. 5,00,000/- (five
  lakhs), it is contended that the settled principal of law being
  that a penalty cannot be construed as punishment or
  commission of crime, no such direction can be issued under
  <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_40">Section 33A</a> of the Act.    In support of his submissions the
  decision in the case of N.K. Jain and Ors. Vs C.K. Shah and
  Ors. (1991) 2 SCC 495, was relied upon.
</p>

<p id="p_22">13.     By way of alternative argument, Mr. Sibal, submitted
  that even if for the sake of argument it is held that the WBPCB
  had power under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_41">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act, the said power
  can be exercised only in consonance with the provisions of the
  Act and Rules or not at all. Drawing our attention to Rule 34 of
  the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1975, it
  is submitted that the Authorities had not complied with the
  mandatory requirements of the said Rules, in as much as
  before issuance of the impugned directions, the nature of
  action proposed to be taken and the time within which it should
  be complied with, was not intimated nor any show cause was
  called for with regard to the proposed punishment. Placing
  reliance on Sub Rule 5 of Rule 34 it is further submitted, that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                 11</span>


  as no opportunity was granted to the Appellant to file a show
  cause / objection, impugned directions cannot be sustained.
</p>

<p id="p_23">14.     Mr. Soumya Chakraborty, Learned Counsel appearing
  for WBPCB and other Respondents, countenancing the
  arguments advanced on behalf of the Appellant, submitted that
  the powers conferred upon WBPCB under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_42">Section 33A</a> are
  very wide. The Section itself empowers WBPCB to issue any
  directions in exercise of its power and performance of its
  functions.   The directions issued under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_43">Section 33A</a> are
  compensatory in nature. Causing pollution and or harm to the
  environment leading to violation of the norms prescribed under
  the Act and Rules. The same being tortious acts, un-liquidated
  damages in the form of imposition of pollution cost/damages
  can be directed.        The directions issued to furnish a Bank
  Guarantee were aimed to secure future observance of
  environmental norms and the same should not be construed as
  a penalty. Thus, according to Mr. Chakraborty, WBPCB acted
  in consonance with law and the submission to the contrary
  were unfounded.
</p>

<p id="p_24">15.     In support of his submission, several decision of
  Supreme Court dealing with the principles of sustainable
  development,      precautionary         principle   and   polluter   pays
  principle were relied upon. The polluter pays principle, it is
  submitted    is   the    ethos     of     international   environmental
  jurisprudence in the matter of correcting a civil norm by award
  of cost / damages on a polluting industry. The core of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                              12</span>


principle, derives from the fundamental proposition, that the
person who generate pollution should bear the cost of
abatement.       In order to further fortify his submissions, Mr.
Chakraborty relied upon following decisions of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court:-
</p>

<p id="p_25">  i)     Indian Council for <a href="/doc/1818014/" id="a_44">Enviro Legal Action and Ors. vs.
         Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. (1996) 3 SCC 212.
</p><p id="p_26">  ii)    <a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_45">Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum vs. Union of India &amp;

</p><p id="p_29">  v)     <a href="/doc/992326/" id="a_47">Karnatak Industrial Areas Development Board vs. C</a>.
</p><p id="p_30">         Kenchappa &amp; Ors. (2006) 6 SCC 371.
</p><p id="p_31">  vi)    <a href="/doc/197754/" id="a_48">Tirupur Dying Factory Owners Association vs. Noyyal
         River Ayacutdars Protection Association &amp; Or</a>. (2009) 9
         SCC 737.
</p>

<p id="p_32">16.      There    is   absolutely no   quarrel   with   the   legal
   preposition advanced by Mr. Chakraborty. In the case of
   Tirupur Dying Factory Owners Association (Supra), the
   Hon'ble Supreme Court, referring to the all previous
   judgments, concluded that the concept of "Sustainable
   Development" covers the development that meets the
   needs of a person without compromising the ability of the
   future generation to meet their own needs. It means the
   development, that can take place, can be sustained by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                               13</span>


  nature / ecology with or without mitigation. In such matters,
  the required standard is that the risk or harm to the
  environment or to human health is to be decided in public
  interest, according to a reasonable persons test.                The
  development of the industries, irrigations sources and
  power projects are necessary to improve employment
  opportunity and generation of revenue, therefore, cannot be
  ignored. In such, eventuality, a balance has to be struck for
  the reasons that if the activity is allowed to go on, there may
  be irreparable damage to the environment and there may
  be irreparable damage to the economic interest.
</p>

<p id="p_33">17.     The precautionary principle and the principle of polluter
  pays are the integral part and parcel of National
  environmental law. An Industry or a person who pollutes
  the   surrounding    area        or   environment   is   bound    to
  compensate the persons who have suffered the loss
  because of the activity.         An industry or a person being
  responsible for causing the pollution cannot escape the
  responsibility of not meeting the expenses of removing the
  damages caused and restoring the environment to its
  original position.
</p>

<p id="p_34">  Section 20 of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) Act, 2010
  clearly lays down the principle upon which this Tribunal
  should function. The said Section reads as follows:-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                           14</span>


<p id="p_35">  " 20. Tribunal to apply certain principles:- The Tribunal
  shall, while passing any order or decision or award,
  apply the principles of sustainable development, the
  precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle."
</p>

<p id="p_36">  Thus it is no more res-integra, with regard to the legal
  proposition that a polluter is bound to pay and eradicate the
  damage caused by him and restores the environment. He
  is also responsible to pay for the damages caused due to
  the pollution caused by him.
</p>

<p id="p_37">18.    In the case in hand, most of the facts are admitted
  except the allegations that the samples were not collected
  from the Appellant's plant following the prescribed norms of
  <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_49">Section 21</a> of the Water Act and that no adequate
  opportunity of hearing was granted to the officers of the
  Appellant concern before issuing the impugned directions.
  The said allegations are stoutly denied by the Respondents.
  Be that as it may, the allegations and counter allegations
  being factual aspects, we do not propose to enter into such
  factual disputes at this stage, as the controversy can be
  decided on other broader issues.
</p>

<p id="p_38">19.    The most crucial issue which needs to be determined
  is with regard to the power of the WBPCB to issue
  directions under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_50">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act. According to
  Mr. Sibal , the power under the said Section cannot be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                              15</span>


construed to be an unbridled one and should always be
subject to other provisions of Act and Rules.        Whereas
according to Mr. Chakraborty, exercising the powers under
<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_51">Section 33A</a> , the WBPCB can issue any direction in writing
and such powers cannot be restricted or curtailed.
</p>

<p id="p_39">      <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_52">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act, stipulates that
notwithstanding anything contend in any other law, but
subject to the portions of the said Act, and to any direction
issued by the Central Government, a Board may, in exercise
of the powers and performance of its functions under the
Act, issue any directions.
</p>

<p id="p_40">      Law is well settled that a direction issued by an
Authority should be not only fair, legitimate and above-board,
but also should be without any affection or aversion (See
AIR 1988 SC 157). An authority should not issue any
direction which lacks bonafide and / or otherwise in
justiciable. The rule of law warrants that a direction should
be issued by application of due diligence and the same
should be within the parameters of the known principles,
rules and guidelines. A direction should have nexus to the
facts and circumstances and should not be arbitrary.    It can
be, therefore, safely concluded that <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_53">Section 33A</a> of the
Water Act does not vest an unbridled power upon the Board
and the said power is always subject to reasonable
restrictions prescribed by the provisions of Act and Rule.

<p id="p_41">20.    In the case of    Splendor Landbase Ltd. Vs Delhi
  Pollution Control Committee (Supra) Hon'ble Delhi High
  Court interpreting <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_54">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act, relying
  upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of
  <a href="/doc/32697172/" id="a_55">Khemka     &amp;   Co.   (Agencies)      Pvt.   Ltd.   vs.   State    of

</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">             "In the considered view of this Court, the
             power to levy a penalty on any party is in the
             nature of a penal power. It is settled law that
             unless there is a specific power in the Statute
             enabling the authority to do so. It cannot levy

<p id="p_42">             In paragraph 66 of the judgment the Hon'ble
  Delhi High Court further observed:-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">             "This Court has, therefore, no hesitation in
             coming to the conclusion that orders issued
             by the CMC or even the DPCC in the instant

             of bank guarantees and making the grant of

               conditional upon payment of such penalties
               and furnishing of such bank guarantees are
               entirely without the authority of law and
               require to be set aside. Procedural violations
               by the DPCC."</blockquote>


<p id="p_43">         It is needless to say that the facts of the said case are
  more or less similar to the facts of the case in hand.
</p>

<p id="p_44">21.      According to Mr. Chakraborty, the decision of the
  Hon'ble Delhi High Court being hit by the principles of sub-
  silentio should not be taken as a precedent. It is submitted
  that the Hon'ble High Court has not taken into consideration
  the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court with regard to
  applicability of the principle of the polluter should pay. Thus
  the decision is per incurium.        The said submission is
  strongly repudiated by Mr. Sibal. According to him there is
  no dispute with regard to the principle that polluter should
  pay.     But then while applying the said principle the
  authorities have to assess the damage caused to the
  environment and the amount which is required to restore
  the damage. Referring to the impugned order, Mr. Sibal
  submitted that the Board has neither followed the
  mandatory requirements of the Act and Rule in as much as
  the provisions of Rule 34 were given a complete go-bye nor
  assessed the damages if at all caused, thus the order
  suffers from arbitrariness and is not sustainable in law. We
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                             18</span>


  find some force in the submission of the Learned Counsel
  for the Appellant.
</p>

<p id="p_45">22.    It is admitted that a set of samples were collected by
  the WBPCB from the plant of the Appellant on 5th October,
  2010. The said samples were analyzed and the discharge
  effluent was found to be not in conformity with the
  prescribed parameters, as would be evident from Annexure-
  C-3. WBPCB on the basis of the said analysis report, called
  upon the Appellant to show cause and also directed it to
  rectify the violations. It appears that Appellant submitted a
  reply to the show cause notice, and also assured the
  WBPCB that necessary preventive steps shall be taken to
  rectify the violations.
</p>

<p id="p_46">23.    The WBPCB on 5th October, 2010 once again
  collected some samples and got it analyzed.        The said
  analysis also revealed that the effluents were not in
  consonance with the standards fixed by the Board. The
  Appellant was once again called upon to show cause.
</p>

<p id="p_47">24.    The Appellant, submitted a detailed show cause
  enclosing all documents, and intimated the steps taken for
  eradicating the violations.    Thereafter the officers of the
  WBPCB visited the Plant of the Appellant on 29th
  December, 2010 and collected samples. The said samples
  were duly analyzed and on such analysis, it was found that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                           19</span>


  the discharge effluents satisfied the standard prescribed
  and there was no violation.
</p>

<p id="p_48">25.    The WBPCB on 2nd May, 2011, issued the impugned
  directions relying upon the analysis report of the specimen
  which were collected on 6th August, 2010 and 5th October,
  2010, and called upon the Appellant to deposit Rs.
  5,00,000/0 (five lakhs) towards pollution cost and also
  submit a Bank Guarantee to the tune of 5,00,000/- (five
  lakhs). The said order is silent about the analysis report of
  the specimen collected on December, 2010, though the
  same was available with the WBPCB on the date when the
  direction was issued i.e. May, 2011.
</p>

<p id="p_49">26.    Several contentions of both law and facts were raised
  by the Learned Counsel of both the parties. They have also
  relied upon number of decisions in support of respective
  contentions raised.    However, without entering into the
  arena of controversy we feel, this Appeal can be disposed
  of only on the basis of a factual error.     Admittedly the
  analysis of samples collected from the Appellant's plant on
  6th August, 2010 and 5th October, 2010 revealed that, the
  discharge effluent failed to comply with the standards
  prescribed. The WBPCB, on the basis of such reports, on
  each occasion had issued notice to the Appellant and not
  only called upon it to show cause but also directed them to
  take appropriate measures to maintain the standard with
  regard to the discharged effluent. The Appellant had not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                            20</span>


  only shown cause but also assured the WBPCB that
  necessary steps are being taken to avoid any violation.
  Fact remains the WBPCB did not take any coercive action
  nor issued any direction to the Appellant at that stage and
  remained silent.
</p>

<p id="p_50">27.    WBPCB once again carried out inspection on 29th
  December, 2010 and collected specimen from the Effluent
  Treatment (ET) plant of Appellant. It is not disputed that on
  analysis it was found that the discharge effluent satisfied the
  standards prescribed by the WBPCB and there was no
  violation worth the name.      In spite of the fact that the
  analysis   of   discharged    effluent   collected   from   the
  Appellant's plant in the month of December, 2010, was
  found to be in order after analysis and within the standards
  prescribed, the WBPCB for the reasons best known issued
  the impugned direction in the month of May, 2011. In other
  words when the directions to deposit pollution cost of Rs.
  5,00,000/- (five lakhs) and      as well to submit a bank
  guarantee of Rs. 5,00,000/- (five lakhs) was issued, there
  was no material before the WBPCB leading to the
  conclusion that the Appellant was violating any of the terms
  embodied in the letter of consent or that the discharged
  effluent from the Appellant's ET plant failed to comply with
  the standards prescribed.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                           21</span>


<p id="p_51">       Apart from the aforesaid anomaly, even according to
  law, before applying the principle of "polluter should pay",
  an authority has to first ascertain and determine the
  damage caused by the polluter and the amount which is
  necessary to rectify the damage.       Even otherwise the
  amount so realized is required to be utilized for the purpose
  of restoring the environment and not otherwise.      On the
  absence of such assessment, it would not be justified to
  arbitrarily direct a person to deposit a lump sum amount.
  The aforesaid facts and position of law were not kept in
  mind while passing the impugned order and as such the
  same cannot be sustained in the eye of law.
</p>

<p id="p_52">28.    Before parting we feel it proper to express our concern
  with regard to presence of heavy metals such as lead (Pb)
  and cadmium (Cd.) in the discharged effluent. Presence of
  said substances in the effluent would finally contaminate the
  environment, and shall cause hazards to human life.        It
  appears, no steps, howsoever has been taken by the
  WBPCB or by the Appellant to trace out the source of such
  heavy metals found in the effluent. It is quite possible that
  heavy metals / (Pb, Cd etc.) may also be present in the
  products. We, therefore, direct the WBPCB as well as the
  Appellant to conduct analysis of the water and raw materials
  used for the purpose, and not only detect the source but
  also take appropriate steps for eradicating the same so as
  to avoid any adverse health impacts.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                        22</span>




<p id="p_53">   29.             In view of the discussions made above, we allow the
       Appeal and set aside the direction dated 2nd May, 2011
       issued by the WBPCB and call upon the said Respondent to
       proceed in accordance with law. We also direct the Central
       Pollution Control Board, New Delhi / Zonal office at Kolkata,
       West Bengal to collect the effluent discharged from the
       Appellant's plant following the paraphernalia laid down
       under law, analyze the same in all aspects, particularly with
       regard to presence of heavy metals (Pb, Cd etc.) and
       prepare a report. It is needless to be said that the expenses
       for the said purpose shall be borne by the Appellant
       Company. The cost shall be assessed by the CPCB within
       two weeks from the date of service/production of certified
       copies of this judgment and same shall be deposited by the
       Appellant with the CPCB within two weeks, therefrom. The
       renewal of the consent to operate the plant would be
       dependent on the report of the Central Pollution Control
       Board.
</p>
<p id="p_54">               A copy of this direction be communicated to CPCB, at
       the cost of the Appellant.
