<p id="p_2">JUDGMENT :-
</p><p id="p_3">      Appellate Jurisdiction of this Tribunal under <a href="/doc/725687/" id="a_1">Section
38</a> of the Delhi Rent Control Act (hereinafter to be referred
as   "DRC      Act")       has   been     invoked     by     the
appellant/petitioner, feeling aggrieved by the order dated
15.11.2011 passed by learned Addl. Rent Controller
(Central), Delhi whereby his petition under <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_2">Section 14(1)</a>
</p><p id="p_4">(b) &amp; ( c) of DRC Act was dismissed.
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">(RCT Appeal No.100/2011)                          (Page 1 of 10)
 2-    It will be in the fitness of things to narrate the
</pre><p id="p_5">circumstances leading to the filing of the present appeal.
The petitioner (appellant herein) filed a petition u/section
14(1)(b) and 14(1)(c) of DRC Act, seeking eviction of the
respondent from the premises being a Garage measuring
14'x11' situated on the ground floor of property bearing
No.7/6 Ansari Road, Darya Ganj, New Delhi, inter alia on
the allegations that respondent was inducted as tenant in
respect of suit premises vide agreement dated 9-2-1988 by
the predecessor in interest of the petitioner. Respondent
has sublet, assigned or parted with possession of the
tenanted premises to Shri Anil Kumar, without the written
consent of the petitioner or his predecessor in interest
illegally and unauthorisedly. The premises has been and is
being used for a purpose other than the purpose for which
it was let, inasmuch as that the premises was let out for
commercial purposes but the same is being illegally and
unauthorisedly used for screen printing which is causing
nuisance and health hazard not only to the petitioner and
his family but also to his neighbours, since running of
screen printing job from the suit premises is causing lot of
pollution and is in violation of the provisions of relevant
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Pollution Act</a>. It was alleged that the material which is
stored in the tenanted premises is highly inflammable and
same can be the cause of any untoward incident. The
misuse of the premises has not been stopped despite
service of notice.</p><pre id="pre_3">
3-    Respondent resisted the eviction petition by filing

(RCT Appeal No.100/2011)                      (Page 2 of 10)
</pre><p id="p_6"> written statement. While denying the allegations of the
petitioner, it was stated that the alleged sublettee Anil
Kumar is his son who is helping him in his business and
that respondent is using the premises only for commercial
purpose.
</p><p id="p_7">4-    Petitioner filed replication, wherein he denied the
allegations made in the written statement and reiterated the
stand taken in the main petition.
</p><p id="p_8">5-    Petitioner examined himself as PW 1 in support of
his case, whereas respondent examined himself as RW1.
Besides that, Anil Sharma has appeared as RW2.
6-    After hearing learned Counsel for the parties,
learned Trial Court dismissed the eviction petition on both
counts by observing that petitioner has failed to prove all
the essential ingredients of Section 14(1)(b) and 14(1)(c)
of the DRC Act.
</p><p id="p_9">7- The petitioner/appellant has assailed the findings of the
learned Additional Rent Controller by way of present
appeal.
</p><p id="p_10">8-    Notice of the appeal was issued to the respondents
and trial court record was summoned.
</p><p id="p_11">9-    I have heard Shri Abhishek Gupta, Counsel for the
Appellant, Shri R.D. Mahant, Counsel for respondents and
have perused the record.
</p><p id="p_12">10-   At the outset, learned Counsel for the Appellant
conceded that although the eviction petition was filed on
two grounds i.e. under Section 14(1)(b) and 14(1)(c) of the
DRC Act, however, as regards the ground under Section

(RCT Appeal No.100/2011)                      (Page 3 of 10)
 14(1)(c), no cogent evidence was led and therefore,
petition was dismissed on this score. He is not pressing
this appeal on this ground of eviction. However, it was
submitted by the learned Counsel for the Appellant that the
impugned order qua ground under Section 14(1)(b) of the
DRC Act is contrary to law inasmuch as important aspects
of evidence have not been considered and reliance was
placed on 1976 RLR (SC) 634, Damadi Lal etc. v. Paras
Ram etc.. It was further submitted that since the tenant
admitted the presence of stranger in the suit premises, the
onus shifted upon him to prove that in what capacity he is
occupying the premises and that he has not sublet,
assigned or parted with possession of the suit premises.
The learned trial court proceeded on an absolutely
incorrect presumption that respondent was merely to prove
that sub-tenant Anil Sharma is his son and nothing more.
The learned Trial Court did not consider the vital aspects
of cross-examination of witnesses of the respondent
inasmuch as RW1 stated that he does not file income tax
return and that he does not visit the suit premises and his
son is an income tax assessee and he files income tax
return. His son RW2 admitted that he files income tax
return and this was the only source of his income from the
business which he carries out with his father. This
admission leads to the conclusion that original tenant has
no concern with the suit premises and it is the sub-lettee
who is in the full control of the business being carried out
from there. As such, it was submitted that impugned order

(RCT Appeal No.100/2011)                      (Page 4 of 10)
 be set-aside and eviction order be passed against the
respondents.
</p><p id="p_13">11-   Rebutting the contention of learned counsel for the
appellant, it was submitted by learned Counsel for the
respondent that the impugned order is reasoned one and
there is no infirmity in the impugned order. The entire
case is covered by 1988(2) All India Rent Control
Journal, 123, Jagan Nath (deceased) through L.Rs v.
Chander Bhan &amp; Others; and AIR 1995 SC 380 <a href="/doc/1080487/" id="a_4">United
Bank of India v. Coocks and Kalvey Properties (P) Ltd.
As</a> such, it was submitted that appeal is liable to be
dismissed.
</p><p id="p_14">12-   I have given my thoughtful consideration to the
respective contentions of the learned Counsel for the
parties and have carefully perused the record.
13-   A perusal of the record goes to show that the
petitioner/ appellant sought eviction of the respondent on
the grounds that respondent who vide agreement dated
09.02.1988 was inducted as a tenant in the suit premises @
Rs.200/- per month excluding electricity charges, has
sublet, assigned or otherwise parted with the possession of
the tenanted premises to Anil Kumar without the written
consent of the petitioner, illegally and unauthorisedly. The
premises has been and is being used for a purpose other
than the purpose for which it was let out.
</p><p id="p_15">14-   The respondent has taken a specific stand that the
alleged sublettee Anil Kumar is his son who is helping him
in his business. It was also denied that the premises are

(RCT Appeal No.100/2011)                         (Page 5 of 10)
 being used for the purpose other than the purpose for
which it was let out.
</p><p id="p_16">15-   It goes without saying that when an eviction petition
is filed on the ground under Section 14(1)(b) of the DRC
Act, it is incumbent upon the petitioner to prove:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      i)     there exists relationship of landlord
             and tenant between the parties;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      ii)    the tenant has on or after 9th day of
             June, 1952, sublet, assigned or
             otherwise parted with possession of
             whole or any part of the tenanted
             premises; and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      iii)   that he did so without obtaining the
             consent of landlord in writing.</blockquote>
<p id="p_17">16-   As     regards    the   first   ingredient,    regarding
relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties,
there is no dispute.
</p><p id="p_18">17-   It is the case of the appellant/petitioner that premises
has been sublet by respondent to Anil Kumar.           In the
written statement, presence of Anil Kumar in the suit
premises is not disputed by the respondent. However, it is
the case of the respondent that Anil Kumar is his son and
in that capacity, he is helping him in his business. That
being so, the question for consideration is whether the
mischief contemplated under Section 14(1)(b) of DRC Act
has been committed by the tenant by subletting, assigning
or parting with possession of the whole or part of the suit
premises without obtaining consent in writing of the
landlord. There is no dispute that there was no consent in

(RCT Appeal No.100/2011)                        (Page 6 of 10)
 writing of the landlord in this case. In order to prove the
subletting, there should exist relationship of landlord and
tenant between the tenant and the sub-tenant. In order to
prove parting with possession, it has to be proved that the
possession has been given to a person other than those to
whom the possession has been given by the lessor and
parting with the possession must have been by the tenant.
Mere user by other person is not parting with possession,
so long as the tenant retains the legal possession with
himself. In fact, there must be vesting of possession by the
tenant in another person by divesting himself not only of
physical possession but also of the right to possession. So
long as the tenant retains the right to possession, there is
no parting with possession in terms of clause (b) of Section
14(1) of the DRC Act. Much emphasis has been laid by
the learned Counsel for Appellant for submitting that it
was admitted by respondent that he is not an income tax
assessee. At one stage he admitted that he does not visit
the suit premises but at second stage, admitted that he
visits the suit premises occasionally. He admitted that his
son is an income tax assessee and files income tax return.
The son of tenant i.e. RW2 (Anil Kumar) admitted in
cross- examination that he files income tax return. The
only source of his income is the business which he carries
out from the suit premises. He has also employed the
person for bringing and delivering the goods.         He is
depositing electricity bills. From this cross-examination,
learned Counsel for the appellant wants the court to draw

(RCT Appeal No.100/2011)                      (Page 7 of 10)
 an inference that the tenant has parted with possession of
the suit premises in favour of his son. As stated above, it
is not only the physical possession, but also right to
possession which has to be divested by the tenant in favour
of stranger before the court could come to the conclusion
that the tenant had parted with the possession of the suit
premises. In the instant case, no evidence has come on
record to prove that the tenant has lost his physical as well
as legal possession over the suit premises. In fact, even no
suggestion was given to the respondent that he ceased to
have any legal possession over the suit premises and now
the premises are in exclusive possession of Shri Anil
Kumar.
</p><p id="p_19">18-   Jagan Nath (deceased) through L.Rs (supra) relied
upon by the learned Counsel for respondents was also a
case where the eviction petition was filed under Section
14(1)(a) and 14(1)(b) of the DRC Act and it was claimed
by the landlord that the tenant had parted with possession
of the premises in question in favour of his sons Baldev
Raj Bindra and Sat Pal Bindra. Besides, his oral evidence,
the landlord also produced on record one statement made
before the Income Tax Officer which indicated that the
tenant who was the proprietor of the Tent House sold the
same to his sons for a sum of Rs.18,000/- and got cash of
Rs.8,000/- and thereafter he gifted the to his sons. It had
also come in the statement that his sons Sat Pal Bindra and
Baldev Raj Bindra have entered into partnership in the
same name of M/s Bindra Tent House in the same

(RCT Appeal No.100/2011)                       (Page 8 of 10)
 premises.    Photocopy of stamp vendor register was also
produced to prove that non judicial paper was purchased
by Baldev Raj for partnership purposes in the name of M/s
Bindra Tent House.     Evidence was also led to the effect
that electricity connection was also obtained by Sat Pal
Bindra in the name of M/s Bindra Tent House. Despite all
this, evidence having come on record, Hon'ble Supreme
Court held that even though the father had retired from the
business and the sons had been looking after the business,
it can not be said that the father had divested himself of the
legal right to be in possession .If the father has a right to
displace the possession of the occupants, i.e. his sons, it
can not be said that tenant had parted with the possession.
19-   In United Bank of India (supra), the tenant bank
inducted Trade Union into the premises for carrying on
trade union activities.    No monetary consideration was
received by the bank from Trade Union. The bank retained
its power to call upon the Trade Union to vacate premises
at any time and the bank was maintaining the premises at
its own expenses and also paying charges for electricity
consumed by the Trade Union. It was held that the bank
can not be held liable for eviction under Section 13(1)(a)
of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956.
20-   In view of these authoritative pronouncements,
coupled with the fact that alleged sub tenant is none else
but son of the tenant and even if he is carrying on the
business in the suit premises, no cogent evident has come
on record to establish that tenant has divested himself of

(RCT Appeal No.100/2011)                        (Page 9 of 10)
 the control of the suit premises or that the premises are in
exclusive possession of alleged sub-lettee. That being so,
there is no infirmity in the impugned order passed by
learned Additional Rent Controller which calls for
interference. Therefore, the appeal is dismissed.
