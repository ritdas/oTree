<p id="p_1">PRESENT:
</p>
<p id="p_2">Justice A.S. Naidu (Acting Chairperson)
Dr. G.K. Pandey (Expert Member)


                                   Dated 20th September, 2012



      By consent of parties this Appeal is disposed of at

admission stage.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">     M/s. Girdhars International Private Limited, has filed this

Appeal assailing the directions issued by Delhi Pollution

Control Committee (DPCC), vide letter no. DPCC/CMC-

I/29126 to 30 dated 21st August, 2012, in exercise of powers

conferred under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_1">Section 33(A)</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp;

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_3">Section 31(A)</a> of the Air

(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 directing closure

of the unit of Appellant as well as disconnection of electricity

and water supply.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3</span><p id="p_5">


</p><p id="p_6">2.   The Appellant is manufacturing candles at its unit

located at F-16, Udyog Nagar, Peera Garhi, New Delhi since

2005. The unit is a small scale industry and is 100% export

oriented.    It is said that about 200 labourers (skilled and

unskilled) are employed in this unit and the annual turnover is

about Rs. 25 crores. This unit is coming under the orange

category and is existing/operating since 10th November, 2006.

It had obtained necessary consent from the Delhi Pollution

Control Committee and the said consent was valid upto 6th

June, 2009. The Appellant applied to DPCC for renewal of the

consent on 4th September, 2009 in the prescribed Form.

DPCC by order dated 2nd June, 2011 refused to grant consent

for extension of the permission. DPCC also issued directions

on the same day i.e. 2nd June, 2011 for closure of the unit and

for disconnection of electricity and water supply. According to

the Appellant, the Respondent DPCC did not issue any Show

Cause Notice before issuing the order refusing to extend

permission, and as such great prejudice was caused to the

Appellant.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  4</span><p id="p_7">


</p><p id="p_8">3.    The Appellant after receiving the above order dated

2nd June, 2011 filed a representation before the DPCC, and

brought to its notice, that it had complied with all the directions

issued and stipulation made by the DPCC and that there was

no reason for non-renewal of the consent to operate.        It was

further contended that from the test reports submitted by the

Appellant, it would be evident that the unit was not a polluting

unit. It is alleged that the test reports were not considered by

the DPCC and without application of mind, the impugned

direction dated 21st August, 2012 was issued under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_5">Section

33(A)</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 and <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_7">Section 31(A)</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, for closure of the unit and disconnection

of electricity and water supply.      The impugned order and

directions   having    been    passed    erroneously     are   not

sustainable in law.     That apart, the orders were passed

without given any opportunity to the Appellant to show cause,

nor any opportunity of being heard was accorded, thus,

according to Learned Counsel Mr. Sumit Tomar, there was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 5</span>


gross violation of the Principles of Natural Justice and equity

and the order cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">4.     Mr. Sumit Tomar, Learned Counsel for the Appellant

further submitted that the Appellant's unit has been operating

after obtaining necessary consent and has also applied for

renewal of the consent in the year 2009, but unfortunately no

action was taken by the DPCC till 21st August, 2012, when the

impugned directions / orders were issued for closure of the

unit and disconnection of electricity and water supply.

Learned Counsel for the Appellant re-iterated that the said

order / direction issued by the DPCC is illegal, arbitrary,

without any justification and being in violation of the Principle

of natural justice, should be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">5.     Mr. Narender Pal Singh, Learned Counsel for the

Respondent supported the stand taken by the DPCC and

submitted that it was open to the Appellant to make fresh

application as directed, in view of the changed circumstances.

According to Mr. Singh, instead of filing fresh application, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 6</span>


Appellant insisted to extend the earlier permission, which was

revoked as long back as on 2nd June, 2011 and did not exist in

the eye of law.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">6.     We heard both the Learned Counsel and considered

the materials placed before us including the direction issued

by DPCC on 26th March, 2012 temporarily revoking the order

directing closure of the unit and permitting the unit to function

for a period of 45 (forty five) days. By the said order DPCC

had directed the Appellant to apply afresh for consent to

operate the unit. In view of the direction of DPCC issued on

26th March, 2012, we feel ends of justice would be better

served, if the Appellant is permitted to apply afresh and seek

permission to operate, within a period of two weeks hence. If

the Appellant files an application within two weeks in proper

format, enclosing all documents and fulfilling all requirements

prescribed under law, the DPCC shall consider the same and

take a decision within three weeks from the date of receipt

thereof. Till a final decision is taken by the DPCC on the said

application, no coercive action would be taken against the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               7</span>


unit. In other words, the orders/direction issued by DPCC for

the closure of the unit with disconnection of electricity and

power supply shall remain stayed for a period of three weeks

or till DPCC takes a decision on the application filed by the

Appellant for according consent to operate the unit, whichever

is earlier.   The Bank Guarantees collected shall not be

encashed.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">7.     The DPCC shall conduct such inquiry as deemed

necessary and dispose of the application filed by the

Appellant, in consonance with law. It is needless be said that

if the Appellant do not file the application for fresh consent

within one week, the impugned order shall operate. This order

is passed by consent of Parties.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">8.    The Appeal is disposed of with no costs.
