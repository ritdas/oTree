</pre>

<p id="p_1">Dalveer Bhandari, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.           These     appeals       have     been     filed       by     the       State     of

Uttaranchal          (now     Uttarakhand)           against       the       orders       dated

12.7.2001          and 1.8.2001 passed by the Division Bench of the

High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital in Civil Miscellaneous

Writ Petition No. 689 (M/B) of 2001.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">2.           The appointment of L. P. Nathani was challenged before

the High Court in a Public Interest Litigation on the ground

that    he    could     not   hold     the    august        Office      of    the    Advocate

General       of     Uttarakhand      in     view    of     <a href="/doc/1673997/" id="a_1">Article       165</a>     read      with

<a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_2">Article 217</a> of the Constitution.                     According to the respondent,

Mr. Nathani was ineligible to be appointed as the Advocate

General      because     he    had    attained        the    age     of      62   years     much

before he was appointed as the Advocate General.                                    The High

Court     entertained         the     petition         and     directed           the     State

Government to take decision on the issue raised within 15 days

and apprise the same to the High Court.
</p><p id="p_5">3.           The    State       of   Uttaranchal       preferred            special    leave

petitions before this Court on 6.8.2001. This Court vide order

dated 9.8.2001 stayed the operation of the impugned judgment

of    the     High       Court.       Thereafter       on    11.2.2002,        this    Court

granted leave and directed that the stay already granted shall

continue.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.           It    may     be   pertinent      to    mention        that,     despite       the

service of notice, the respondents who had initially filed the

writ     petition          before       the     High        Court     challenging           the

appointment of Nathani as the Advocate General did not appear

before       this        Court.      This     clearly       demonstrates        the        non-

seriousness and non-commitment of the respondents in filing

the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">5.           Before we proceed to examine the controversy involved

in this case, we deem it appropriate to set out Articles 165

and    217    of     the    Constitution       dealing       with     the    post     of    the

Advocate      General       and      the    qualifications          for   appointment        to

this post in the Constitution.                      <a href="/doc/1673997/" id="a_3">Article 165</a> which deals with

the appointment of the Advocate General for the States is

<p id="p_14">7.       The Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned

judgment observed that the first clause of <a href="/doc/1673997/" id="a_7">Article 165</a> insists

that   the   Governor   shall   appoint   a   person   as   the   Advocate

General who is qualified to be appointed as a Judge of a High

Court.    The qualifications for the appointment of a Judge of a

High Court are prescribed in the second clause of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_8">Article 217.</a>

It is true that the first clause of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_9">Article 217</a> says that a
Judge of a High Court "shall hold office until he attains the

age of 60 years" (at the relevant time the age of retirement

of a Judge of the High Court was 60 years and now it is 62

years).          The Division Bench further held that the real

question then was whether this provision is to be construed as

one   prescribing   a   qualification   or   as   one   prescribing    the

duration of the appointment of a Judge of a High Court.                 It

was further held that as the provision does not occur in the

second clause, it can only be construed as one prescribing the

duration of the appointment of a Judge of a High Court.                The

Court further observed that the provisions about duration in

the first clause of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_10">Article 217</a> cannot be made applicable to

the   Advocate    General   because   the    Constitution   contains     a

specific provision about the duration of the appointment of

the Advocate General in the third clause of <a href="/doc/1673997/" id="a_11">Article 165</a> which

says that the Advocate General shall hold office during the

pleasure of the Governor.        This provision does not limit the

duration of the appointment by reference to any particular

age, as in the case of a Judge, it is not permissible to

import into it the words "until he attains the age of sixty

years".     The specific provision in the Constitution must,

therefore, be given effect to without any limitation.                 If a

person is appointed as an Advocate General, say at the age of

fifty-five years, there is no warrant for holding that he must

cease to hold his office on his attaining sixty two years

because it is so stated about a Judge of a High court in the

first clause of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_12">Article 217.</a>          If that be a true position, as
we hold it is, then the appointment is not bad because the

person   is     past   sixty   two   years,   so   long   as   he   has   the

qualifications prescribed in the second clause of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_13">Article 217.</a>

         the two offices. A Judge of the High Court is
         governed by <a href="/doc/88674/" id="a_15">Art. 221.</a>    The Advocate-General is
         governed by clause (3) of <a href="/doc/1673997/" id="a_16">Art. 165</a> and receives
         such remuneration as the Governor may determine.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">         26.     What the first clause of <a href="/doc/1673997/" id="a_17">Art. 165</a>
         insists is that the Governor shall appoint a
         person who is qualified to be appointed a Judge
         of a High Court to be Advocate-General for the
         State.   The qualifications for the appointment
         of a Judge of a High Court are prescribed in the
         second clause of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_18">Art. 217.</a> It is true that the
         first clause of Art 217 says that a Judge of a
         High Court "shall hold office until he attains
         the age of 60 years". The real question then is
         whether this provision is to be construed as one
         prescribing   a   qualification    or   as   one
         prescribing the duration of the appointment of a
         Judge of a High Court.    As the provision does
         not occur in the second clause, it can only be
         construed as one prescribing the duration of the
         appointment of a Judge of a High Court.

<pre id="pre_2">         27.      The provision about         duration in the
         first    clause of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_19">Art. 217</a>           cannot be made
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_17">applicable to the Advocate-General because the
Constitution contains a specific provision about
the duration of the appointment of the Advocate-
</blockquote><p id="p_16">General in the third clause of <a href="/doc/1673997/" id="a_20">Art. 165</a> which
says that the Advocate-General shall hold office
during the pleasure of the Governor.     As this
provision does not limit the duration of the
appointment by reference to any particular age,
as in the case of a Judge, it is not permissible
to import into it the words "until he attains
the age of sixty years". The specific provision
in the Constitution must therefore be given
effect to without any limitation.    If a person
is appointed Advocate-General, say at the age of
fifty-five, there is no warrant for holding that
he must cease to hold his office on this
attaining sixty years because it is so stated
about a Judge of a High Court in the first
clause of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_21">Art. 217.</a>      If that be the true
position, as we hold it is, then the appointment
is not bad because the person is past sixty
years, so long as he has the qualifications
prescribed in the second clause of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_22">Art. 217.</a>
It was not suggested that the non-applicant does
not possess the qualifications prescribed in
that clause.
</p>
<p id="p_17">28.     The provision that every Judge of a High
Court "shall hold office until he attains the
age of sixty years" has two aspects to it. While
in one aspect it can be viewed as a guarantee of
tenure during good behaviour to a person
appointed as a Judge of a High Court until he
attains the age of sixty, in another aspect it
can be viewed as a disability in that a Judge
cannot hold his office as of right after he
attains the age of sixty years.
</p>
<p id="p_18">29.     We say as of right because under Art.
</p><p id="p_19">224 a person who has retired as a Judge of a
High Court may be requested to sit and act as a
Judge of a High court.    The attainment of the
age of sixty by a person cannot therefore be
regarded as a disqualification for performing
the functions of a Judge.       But the learned
counsel for the applicant tried to distinguish
between the case of a person qualified to be
appointed a Judge of a High Court under <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_23">Article
217</a> and the case of a person requested to sit
and act as a Judge under <a href="/doc/570782/" id="a_24">Article 224.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_20">       The distinction between the case of a
person qualified to be appointed a Judge of a
High Court under <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_25">Article 217</a> and the case of a
person requested to sit and act under <a href="/doc/570782/" id="a_26">Article
224</a> is not with respect to the qualifications
for performing the functions of a Judge, but
with respect to the matters provided by <a href="/doc/88674/" id="a_27">Article
221</a><a href="/doc/819787/" id="a_28">, 222</a><a href="/doc/1931158/" id="a_29">, 223</a>, etc.      In the language of the
Constitution   a   Judge   does  not  lose   the
qualifications prescribed in the second clause
of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_30">Article 217</a> on the attainment of the age of
sixty years.     A person who attains that age
cannot be appointed as a Judge not because he is
not qualified to be so appointed within the
meaning of the second clause of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_31">Article 217</a>, but
because the first clause of that Article
expressly provides that a Judge shall hold
office until he attains the age of sixty years.

(30) If the provision in the first clause of
<a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_32">Article 217</a> viewed as a guarantee of tenure of
office until the age of sixty is not available
to the Advocate-General because he holds office
during the pleasure of the Governor, we see no
compelling   reason  why   the   same   provision
construed as a disability should be made
applicable to him.    We are, therefore, of the
view that the first clause of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_33">Article 217</a> cannot
be read with the first clause of <a href="/doc/1673997/" id="a_34">Article 165</a> so
as to disqualify a person from being appointed
Advocate-General after the age of sixty years.
We have no doubt on the point. Even if the
question be considered as not free from doubt,
as the applicant desires to construe the first
clause of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_35">Article 217</a> as a disabling provision
against the non-applicant, we cannot forget that
provisions entailing disabilities have to be
construed   strictly:    `<a href="/doc/3811/" id="a_36">Parameshwaram    Pillai
Bhaskara Pillai v. State</a>', 1950-5 Dom L R (Trav)
</p><p id="p_21">382.   The canon of construction approved by
their Lordships of the Privy Council is that if
there be any ambiguity as to the meaning of a
disabling provision, the construction which is
in favour of the freedom of the individual
should be given effect to : `David v. De'silva',
(1934) A C 106 at p. 114.
</p>
<p id="p_22">(31)    There is no force in the contention that
the non-applicant could not have been appointed
Advocate-General because he had retired as a
Judge of the High Court.     The learned counsel
referred us to Clause (4)(a) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_37">Article 22</a> of
the   Constitution   and   submitted   that  the
Constitution makes a distinction between a
person who has been a Judge and one who is
qualified to be appointed as a Judge of a High
Court. The provision in our view only makes an
        exhaustive enumeration of the classes of persons
        who can constitute an Advisory Board.       Such
        persons must either be or must have been or must
        be qualified to be appointed as Judges of a High
        Court.   The provision has therefore no bearing
        on the question whether the first clause of
        <a href="/doc/1673997/" id="a_38">Article 165</a> has to be read with the first clause
        of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_39">Article 217</a>, which question we have already
        answered in the negative. The case of the non-
</p><p id="p_23">        applicant is unique.       <a href="/doc/1723094/" id="a_40">Article 220</a> is not
        applicable to him because he did not hold office
        as a Judge of the High Court after the
        commencement of the Constitution. So the bar
        contained in that Article also does not come in
        his way."

settled by a judgment of this Court, it has been raised from

demonstrate    that     after   the   controversy   has     been   finally

settled by this Court, the filing of indiscriminate petitions

with   the    same    relief    creates   unnecessary     strain   on   the

to the petitioner, the respondent Milan Banerji had already

attained the age of 65 years and he could not be appointed as

the Attorney General for India.     In that case, the Division

Bench relied upon the judgment of the Division Bench of the

Nagpur High Court in G.D. Karkare's case (supra).      The Court

held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">    "Having   examined   various    provisions     of  the
    Constitution,   it   is    quite    clear    that  the
    Constitution of India does not provide the
    retirement    age    of     various     constitutional
    appointees. No outer age limit has been provided
    for the appointment of the Attorney General,
    Solicitor General and Advocate General in the
    State. In the democratic system, prevailing in our
    country the Attorney General is appointed on the
    recommendation of the Prime Minister by the
    President of India and traditionally, he resigns
    along with the Prime Minister. Learned Counsel for
    the petitioner could not show any law relating to
    the age of retirement of Attorney General or
    embargo provided in Constitution on appointment of
    a person as Attorney General, who has already
    attained the age of 65 years. We are of the
    considered opinion that the letter and spirit of
    the Constitution as far as appointment of the
    Attorney   General    is    concerned,    looking   to
    significance, responsibility and high status of
    the post, it lays down certain requirements for a
    Member of Bar to be appointed as Attorney General
    of India. It is in this backdrop that the framers
    of the Constitution thought it necessary to
    prescribe   minimum   requisite     qualification   by
    laying that a person who is qualified to be
    appointed as Judge of the Hon'ble Court can be
    appointed as Attorney-General of India. This
    situation,   however,    cannot   lead    us   to  the
    conclusion by any stretch of imagination that the
    Attorney General cannot hold his office after the
    age of 65 years. As already indicated herein-above
    there are various constitutional functionaries
    where no outer age limit is provided to hold the
       office."

<p id="p_35">15.       In   view    of   the   clear    enunciation       of    law   in    the

aforesaid judgments, the controversy has been fully settled

that the Advocate General for the State can be appointed after

he/she attains the age of 62 years.                Similarly, the Attorney

General for India can be appointed after he/she attains the

age of 65 years.            In a number of other cases regarding the

appointment of other authorities, the Courts have consistently

realization of the constitutional obligation of the court.


</p><p id="p_63">32.         All these petitions are filed under the big banner of

the public interest litigation.                      In this view of the matter,

it has become imperative to examine what are the contours of

the   public       interest      litigation?              What     is   the    utility      and

importance of the public interest litigation?                             Whether similar

jurisdiction           exists    in     other        countries          or     this    is   an

indigenously developed jurisprudence?                        Looking to the special

conditions         prevalent      in     our    country,           whether      the    public

interest litigation should be encouraged or discouraged by the

courts?       These      are     some    of    the        questions      which    we    would

endeavour to answer in this judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_64">
</p><p id="p_65">33.         According       to     our     opinion,           the       public        interest
litigation is an extremely important jurisdiction exercised by

the Supreme Court and the High Courts.                 The Courts in a number

of cases have given important directions and passed orders

which   have     brought     positive    changes      in    the    country.     The

Courts'    directions        have     immensely       benefited      marginalized

sections of the society in a number of cases.                        It has also

helped in protection and preservation of ecology, environment,

forests,      marine       life,     wildlife      etc.     etc.    The     court's

directions to some extent have helped in maintaining probity

and transparency in the public life.

<p id="p_66">
</p><p id="p_67">34.       This     court     while     exercising      its     jurisdiction      of

judicial review realized that a very large section of the

society because of extreme poverty, ignorance, discrimination

and illiteracy had been denied justice for time immemorial and

in fact they have no access to justice.                      Pre-dominantly, to

provide access to justice to the poor, deprived, vulnerable,

discriminated and marginalized sections of the society, this

court   has      initiated,    encouraged       and    propelled      the     public

interest litigation.           The litigation is upshot and product of

this court's deep and intense urge to fulfill its bounded duty

and constitutional obligation.

<p id="p_68">
</p><p id="p_69">35.       The    High     Courts    followed    this       Court   and    exercised

similar jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_57">article 226</a> of the Constitution.

The courts expanded the meaning of right to life and liberty

guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_58">article 21</a> of the Constitution.                      The rule of

locus   standi      was    diluted     and   the    traditional       meaning    of
`aggrieved person' was broadened to provide access to justice

to a very large section of the society which was otherwise not

getting any benefit from the judicial system.                      We would like

to term this as the first phase or the golden era of the

public    interest     litigation.          We   would      briefly    deal     with

important cases decided by this Court in the first phase after

broadening the definition of `aggrieved person'.                           We would

also deal with cases how this Court prevented any abuse of the

(Railway) v. Union of India &amp; Others</a> AIR 1981 SC 298 at page

317, held that our current processual jurisprudence is not of

individualistic       Anglo-Indian     mould.      It       is   broad-based      and

people-oriented,       and    envisions      access      to      justice    through

`class      actions',        `public        interest         litigation',         and

`representative proceedings'.           Indeed, little Indians in large

numbers     seeking     remedies       in    courts         through    collective

proceedings, instead of being driven to an expensive plurality

of litigations, is an affirmation of participative justice in

our democracy.         We have no hesitation in holding that the

narrow concepts of `cause of action', `person aggrieved' and

individual     litigation       are    becoming        obsolescent         in   some

jurisdictions.

unregistered    Association      espousing       the    cause     of   over     down-

the matter.

<p id="p_74">
</p><p id="p_75">38.         In the said case, this court further held that where a

public interest litigation alleging that certain workmen are

living in bondage and under inhuman conditions is initiated it

is    not    expected      of   the   Government     that     it    should    raise

preliminary      objection         that   no    fundamental     rights   of       the

petitioners or the workmen on whose behalf the petition has

been    filed,      have    been    infringed.       On   the      contrary,      the

Government should welcome an inquiry by the Court, so that if

it is found that there are in fact bonded labourers or even if

the workers are not bonded in the strict sense of the term as

defined in the <a href="/doc/1189857/" id="a_61">Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act</a>, 1976 but

they are made to provide forced labour or any consigned to a

life of utter deprivation and degradation, such a situation

can be set right by the Government.
</p>
<p id="p_76">
</p><p id="p_77">39.         Public interest litigation is not in the nature of

adversary litigation but it is a challenge and an opportunity

to the government and its officers to make basic human rights

meaningful     to    the    deprived      and   vulnerable    sections       of   the

community and to assure them social and economic justice which

is the signature tune of our Constitution.                   The Government and

its officers must welcome public interest litigation because

it would provide them an occasion to examine whether the poor

and the down-trodden are getting their social and economic
entitlements or whether they are continuing to remain victims

of    deception      and   exploitation         at   the   hands    of   strong      and

powerful   sections        of    the    community     and    whether     social      and

economic justice has become a meaningful reality for them or

it has remained merely a teasing illusion and a promise of

unreality,      so    that      in    case    the    complaint      in   the    public

interest litigation is found to be true, they can in discharge

of their constitutional               obligation root out exploitation and

injustice and ensure to the weaker sections their rights and

entitlements.

EVOLUTION OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION IN INDIA

</p><p id="p_83">42.       The origin and evolution of Public Interest Litigation

in     India     emanated        from        realization      of     constitutional

obligation by the Judiciary towards the vast sections of the
society    -     the     poor   and    the   marginalized       sections         of   the

society.         This jurisdiction has been created and carved out

by the judicial creativity and craftsmanship.                       <a href="/doc/1599374/" id="a_64">In M. C. Mehta

&amp; Another v. Union of India &amp; Others</a> AIR 1987 SC 1086, this

Court observed that <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_65">Article 32</a> does not merely confer power on

this     Court      to     issue     direction,     order     or        writ    for   the

enforcement of fundamental rights.                   Instead, it also lays a

constitutional           obligation     on   this     Court        to     protect     the

fundamental rights of the people. The court asserted that, in

realization         of   this   constitutional      obligation,           "it   has   all

incidental and ancillary powers including the power to forge

new remedies and fashion new strategies designed to enforce

the fundamental rights".               The Court realized that because of

extreme poverty, a large number of sections of society cannot

approach the court.                The fundamental rights have no meaning

for them and in order to preserve and protect the fundamental

rights    of     the     marginalized     section     of    society       by    judicial

innovation, the courts by judicial innovation and creativity

started giving necessary directions and passing orders in the

public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_84">43.       The development of public interest litigation has been

extremely significant development in the history of the Indian

jurisprudence.             The decisions of the Supreme Court in the

1970's loosened the strict locus standi requirements to permit

filing of petitions on behalf of marginalized and deprived

sections       of    the    society     by   public        spirited       individuals,

institutions and/or bodies.               The higher Courts exercised wide
powers   given   to    them   under   Articles   32    and   226    of   the

Constitution.      The sort of remedies sought from the courts in

the public interest litigation goes beyond award of remedies

to the affected individuals and groups.               In suitable cases,

the courts have also given guidelines and directions.                    The

courts have monitored implementation of legislation and even

formulated guidelines in absence of legislation.             If the cases

of the decades of 70s and 80s are analyzed, most of the public

interest litigation cases which were entertained by the courts

are   pertaining      to   enforcement   of   fundamental     rights      of

marginalized and deprived sections of the society.                 This can

be termed as the first phase of the public interest litigation

in India.
</p>
<p id="p_85">44.      The Indian Supreme Court broadened the traditional rule

of standing and the definition of "person aggrieved".


</p><p id="p_86">45.      In this judgment, we would like to deal with the origin

and development of public interest litigation.                We deem it

appropriate to broadly divide the public interest litigation

in three phases.
</p>
<p id="p_87">            Phase-I: It deals with cases of this Court
            where directions and orders were passed
            primarily to protect fundamental rights under
            <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_66">Article 21</a> of the marginalized groups and
            sections of the society who because of
            extreme poverty, illiteracy and ignorance
            cannot approach this court or the High
            Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_88">            Phase-II: It deals with the cases relating to
            protection,    preservation    of    ecology,
            environment, forests, marine life, wildlife,
            mountains, rivers, historical monuments etc.
            etc.
</p><p id="p_89">           Phase-III: It deals with the directions issued
           by the Courts in maintaining the probity,
           transparency and integrity in governance.

</p><p id="p_90">46.     Thereafter, we also propose to deal with the aspects of

abuse of the Public Interest Litigation and remedial measures

by which its misuse can be prevented or curbed.


DISCUSSION OF SOME IMPORTANT CASES OF PHASE-I

</p><p id="p_91">47.     The   court   while   interpreting   the   words    "person

aggrieved" in <a href="/doc/1749406/" id="a_67">Jasbhai Motibhai Desai v. Roshan Kumar, Haji

Bashir Ahmed &amp; Others</a> (1976) 1 SCC 671 observed that "the

traditional rule is flexible enough to take in those cases

where the applicant has been prejudicially affected by an act

or omission of an authority, even though he has no proprietary

or even a fiduciary interest in the subject-matter.           That

apart, in exceptional cases even a stranger or a person who

was not a party to the proceedings before the authority, but

has a substantial and genuine interest in the subject-matter

of the proceedings will be covered by this rule".


</p><p id="p_92">48.     The rule of locus standi was relaxed in <a href="/doc/1553344/" id="a_68">Bar Council of

Maharashtra v. M. V. Dabholkar &amp; Others</a> 1976 SCR 306.           The

      NAACP-National Association for Advancement of
      Coloured   People-in   America),   emerges   in   a
      developing country like ours, this pattern of
      public oriented litigation better fulfils the rule

<p id="p_93">49.      The       court    in        this   case         observed      that           "procedural

standing      by    authorizing          community            litigation.               The    Court

entertained a writ petition from a prisoner, a disinterested

party, objecting to the torture of a fellow prisoner.                                              The

Court    entertained            the     writ       after       reasoning           that       "these

'martyr' litigations possess a beneficent potency beyond the

individual      litigant         and     their       consideration            on        the    wider

representative           basis         strengthens             the      rule           of      law."

Significantly, citing "people's vicarious involvement in our

justice system with a broad-based concept of locus standi so

necessary in a democracy where the masses are in many senses

weak,"   the       Court   permitted           a    human      rights    organization               to

intervene in the case on behalf of the victim.

justice to them. The poor in their contact with the legal

system have always been on the wrong side of the line. They

have always come across 'law for the poor" rather than law of

the poor'. The law is regarded by them as something mysterious

and forbidding--always taking something away from them and not

as a positive and constructive social device for changing the

social economic order and improving their life conditions by

conferring rights and benefits on them. The result is that the

legal system has lost its credibility for the weaker section

of the community.

(supra), this Court observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">      "that public interest litigation which is a
      strategic arm of the legal aid movement and which
      is intended to bring justice within the reach of
the poor masses, who constitute the low visibility
area of humanity, is a totally different kind of
litigation     from     the    ordinary     traditional
litigation which is essentially of an adversary
character where there is a dispute between two
litigating parties, one making claim or seeking
relief against the other and that other opposing
such claim or resisting such relief. Public
interest litigation is brought before the court
not for the purpose of enforcing the right of one
individual against another as happens in the case
of ordinary litigation, but it is intended to
promote   and   vindicate    public   interest    which
demands that violations of constitutional or legal
rights of large numbers of people who are poor,
ignorant   or    in   a   socially   or    economically
disadvantaged position should not go unnoticed and
un-redressed. That would be destructive of the
Rule of Law which forms one of the essential
elements of public interest in any democratic form
of government. The Rule of Law does not mean that
the protection of the law must be available only
to a fortunate few or that the law should be
allowed to be prostituted by the vested interests
for protecting and upholding the status quo under
the guise of enforcement of their civil and
political rights. The poor too have civil and
political rights and the Rule of Law is meant for
them also, though today it exists only on paper
and not in reality. If the sugar barons and the
alcohol kings have the Fundamental Right to carry
on their business and to fatten their purses by
exploiting    the    consuming    public,    have   the
'chamars' belonging to the lowest strata of
society no Fundamental Right to earn an honest
living through their sweat and toil? The former
can approach the courts with a formidable army of
distinguished lawyers paid in four or five figures
per day and if their right of exploit is upheld
against   the    government   under    the   label   of
Fundamental Right, the courts are praised for
their boldness and courage and their independence
and fearlessness are applauded and acclaimed. But,
if the Fundamental Right of the poor and helpless
victims of injustice is sought to be enforced by
public   interest     litigation,    the    so   called
champions of human rights frown upon it as waste
of time of the highest court in the land, which,
according to them, should not engage itself in
such small and trifling matters. Moreover, these
self-styled human rights activists forget that
civil   and    political    rights,    priceless    and
invaluable as they are for freedom and democracy,
simply do not exist for the vast masses of our
      people. Large numbers of men, women and children
      who constitute the bulk of our population are
      today living a sub-human existence in conditions
      of abject poverty: utter grinding poverty has
      broken their back and sapped their moral fibre.
      They have no faith in the existing social and
      economic system. What civil and political rights
      are these poor and deprived sections of humanity
      going to enforce?

altogether      dismissed     the   traditional     rule   of    standing,     and

replaced it with a liberalized modern rule.                 In this case, the

Court awarded standing to advocates challenging the transfer

as an "ancient vintage" of "an era when private law dominated

the legal scene and public law had not been born," the Court

concluded that the traditional rule of standing was obsolete.

In    its     place,   the    Court    prescribed    the     modern     rule   on

the modern rule to bring cases challenging the transfer of

observed as under:

      or it is not practicable for him to move the Court
      for some other sufficient reasons, such as his
      socially or economically disadvantaged position,
      some other person can invoke assistance of the
      Court for the purpose of providing judicial
      redress to the person wronged or injured, so that
      the legal wrong or injury caused to such person
      does not go un-redressed and justice is done to
      him.

      methods and devise new strategies for the purpose
      of providing access to justice to large masses of
      people who are denied their basic human rights and
      to whom freedom and liberty have no meaning. The
      only way in which this can be done is by
      entertaining writ petitions and even letters from

of Indians go to mines and undertake hazardous work without

The     court     in     this       case      has       clearly      laid        down    that    an

enterprise       which       is     engaged        in    a       hazardous       or     inherently

health and safety of the persons working in the factory and

residing in the surrounding area owes an absolute and non-

results    to        anyone       on    account         of       hazardous       or     inherently

dangerous nature of the activity which it has undertaken.                                       The

standards of safety and if any harm results on account of such

activity,        the     enterprise            must         be     absolutely          liable    to

effluents discharged by tanneries into Ganga river in Kanpur.
The court called for the report of the Committee of experts

and gave directions to save the environment and ecology.                               It

was held that "in Common Law the Municipal Corporation can be

restrained by an injunction in an action brought by a riparian

owner who has suffered on account of the pollution of the

water in a river caused by the Corporation by discharging into

the river insufficiently treated sewage from discharging such

sewage into the river.             But in the present case the petitioner

is    not   a    riparian     owner.        He    is     a    person      interested   in

protecting the lives of the people who make use of the water

would not be reasonable to expect any particular person to

treatment plants.        Just like an industry which cannot pay

minimum wages to its workers cannot be allowed to exist, a

<blockquote id="blockquote_40">      "26. Certain principles were enunciated in the

      guidelines for the purposes of sustaining humanity
      and its environment.    Of these parameters, a few
      principles are extracted which are of relevance to

      natural resources of the earth including the air,
      water,    land,   flora   and    fauna   especially
      representative samples of natural eco-systems must
      be safeguarded for the benefit of present and
      future generations through careful planning and
      management as appropriate. In the same vein, the

      development. The need for economic development has
      been dealt with in Principle 8 where it is said
      that "economic and social development is essential

the    cost   of    ecology          or    by     causing     widespread    environment

destruction and violation; at the same time, the necessity to

preserve ecology and environment should not hamper economic

and other developments.                Both development and environment must

go     hand   in    hand,       in        other    words,     there   should    not     be

development at the cost of environment and vice versa, but

there should be development while taking due care and ensuring

the protection of environment.

interest. The courts made a serious endeavour to protect and

preserve ecology, environment, forests, hills, rivers, marine

life, wildlife etc. etc.        This can be called the second phase
of the public interest litigation in India.



THE TRANSPARENCY AND PROBITY IN GOVERNANCE - PHASE-III OF THE
PUBLIC INTERST LITIGATION


</p><p id="p_192">106.       In the 1990's, the Supreme Court expanded the ambit and

scope of public interest litigation further.                       The High Courts

also under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_128">Article 226</a> followed the Supreme Court and passed a

number     of     judgments,        orders    or     directions          to     unearth

corruption and maintain probity and morality in the governance

of the State.       The probity in governance is a sine qua non for

an efficient system of administration and for the development

of   the   country       and   an   important       requirement         for   ensuring

probity in governance is the absence of corruption.                           This may

broadly be called as the third phase of the Public Interest

Litigation.       The    Supreme    Court    and    High       Courts    have    passed

significant orders.
</p>
<p id="p_193">

case, the petitioner, who was a journalist, filed a public

interest        litigation.           According          to     him,     the      prime

investigating           agencies     like      the        Central        Bureau        of

Investigation and the Revenue authorities failed to perform

their legal obligation and take appropriate action when they

found,     during       investigation        with    a        terrorist,      detailed

accounts     of   vast    payments,     called      `Jain       diaries',       made   to

influential politicians and bureaucrats and direction was also

sought in case of a similar nature that may occur hereafter.
A number of directions were issued by the Supreme Court.                                  The

Court in that case observed that "it is trite that the holders

of   public   offices      are   entrusted          with    certain         power    to   be

exercised in public interest alone and, therefore, the office

is held by them in trust for the people."

undertaken was to divert the River Yamuna and to reclaim 75

acres of land between Agra Fort and the Taj Mahal and use the

reclaimed     land    for      constructing          food       plazas,       shops       and

amusement     activities.         The    Court       directed         for    a   detailed

enquiry    which     was    carried      out    by     the      Central       Bureau      of

Investigation (CBI).             On the basis of the CBI report, the

Court     directed     registration            of    FIR        and     made        further

investigation in the matter.               The court questioned the role
played by the concerned Minister for Environment, Government

of Uttar Pradesh and the Chief Minister, Government of Uttar

the Chief Minister and Environment Minister after they were

extraneous considerations are taken into consideration except

EVOLUTION OF PUBLIC INTERST LITIGATION IN OTHER JUDICIAL
SYSTEMS NAMELY, USA, U.K., AUSTRALIA AND SOUTH AFRICA.

AUSTRALIA

</p><p id="p_213">118.     In   Australia     also   for   protecting       environment,     the

Australian    court   has    diluted     the   principle     of    `aggrieved

person'.
</p>
<p id="p_214">
</p><p id="p_215">119.     In Australia, Public Interest Litigation has been a

method   of   protecting    the    environment.     The   courts    have   not

given a definition of `Public Interest Litigation', but in

Oshlack v Richmond River Council (1998) 193 CLR 72 : (1998)

152 ALR 83, the High Court of Australia (apex court) upheld

the concept and pointed out the essential requirements. McHugh

J., quoted Stein J., from the lower court:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">       "In summary I find the litigation to be properly
       characterised as public interest litigation. The
       basis of the challenge was arguable, raising
       serious and    significant issues   resulting in
       important   interpretation  of   new   provisions
       relating to the protection of endangered fauna.</blockquote><p id="p_216">
</p><p id="p_217">       The application concerned a publicly notorious
       site amidst continuing controversy. Mr. Oshlack
       had nothing to gain from the litigation other than
       the   worthy   motive   of   seeking   to   uphold
       environmental   law   and  the   preservation   of
       endangered fauna."
</p>
<p id="p_218">
</p><p id="p_219">120.      To the court it was important that the petitioner did

not have any other motive than the stated one of protecting

the environment. The test therefore in Australia seems to be

that the petitioner when filing a public interest litigation,

should not stand to gain in some way.
</p>
<p id="p_220">
U.S.A.
</p>
<p id="p_221">121.      The    US     Supreme     Court    realized    the    constitutional

obligation of reaching to all segments of society particularly

the    black         Americans     of   African       origin.      The   courts'

craftsmanship and innovation is reflected in one of the most

celebrated path-breaking judgment of the US Supreme Court in

Oliver Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka 347 U.S. 483,

489-493      (1954).             Perhaps,    it   would        accomplish     the

constitutional obligation and goal. In this case, the courts

have carried out their own investigation and in the judgment

it is observed that "Armed with our own investigation" the

courts held that all Americans including Americans of African

origin can study in all public educational institutions. This

was    the   most      significant      development     in   the    history   of

American judiciary.
</p>
<p id="p_222">
</p><p id="p_223">122.      The US Supreme Court dismissed the traditional rule of

Standing        in     Association      of     Data     Processing       Service

Organizations v. William B. Camp 397 U.S. 150 (1970).                         The
court    observed    that    a    plaintiff   may   be   granted   standing

whenever he/she suffers an "injury in fact" - "economic or

otherwise".

<p id="p_224">
</p><p id="p_225">123.     In another celebrated case Olive B. Barrows v. Leola

Jackson 346 U.S. 249 (1953), 73 S.Ct. 1031 the court observed

as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">       "But in the instant case, we are faced with a
       unique situation in which it is the action of the
       state court which might result in a denial of
       constitutional rights and in which it would be
       difficult if not impossible for the persons whose
       rights are asserted to present their grievance
       before   any   court.       Under   the   peculiar
       circumstances of this case, we believe the reasons
       which underlie our rule denying standing to raise
       another's rights, which is only a rule of
       practice, are outweighed by the need to protect
       the fundamental rights which would be denied by
       permitting the damages action to be maintained."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_226">124.     In environment cases, the US Supreme Court has diluted

the stance and allowed organizations dedicated to protection

of environment to fight cases even though such societies are

not directly armed by the action.

</p><p id="p_228">125.     In United States          v. Students Challenging Regulatory

apartment complex, by depriving them of the "social benefits

of living in an integrated community."

<p id="p_230">
</p><p id="p_231">127.      Similarly, the Supreme Court of the United States has

granted    standing         in   certain   situations        to   a    plaintiff    to

challenge injuries sustained by a third party with whom he/she

shares a "close" relationship.

106    (1976),    the       Court    granted   standing      to   two    physicians

challenging the constitutionality of a state statute limiting

abortions.            Similarly, in Caplin v. Drysdale 491 U.S. 617,

623-24 n. 3 (1989), the Court granted standing to an attorney

to challenge a drug forfeiture law that would deprive his

client of the means to retain counsel.

<p id="p_234">
</p><p id="p_235">129.      The    Supreme         Court   has   also    granted        organizational

standing.        In Robert Warth v. Ira Seldin 422 U.S. 490, 511

(1975), the Court declared that "even in the absence of injury

to itself, an association may have standing solely as the

representative         of    its     members."        This    judgment     had     far

reaching consequence.               In James B. Hunt v. Washington State

Apple Advertising Commission, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977), the

Court elaborated the parameters for organizational standing

where an organization or association "has standing to bring

suit on behalf of its members when: (a) its members would

otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the

interests        it     seeks       to   protect      are     germane       to     the

organization's purpose; (c) neither the claim asserted, nor
the relief requested, requires the participation of individual

members in the lawsuit".

judiciary      prescribed     broad     rules    of    standing.       Under      the

traditional      rule   of    standing,      judicial       redress       was     only

available to a `person aggrieved' - one "who has suffered a

legal   grievance,      a    man   against      whom    a   decision      has     been

pronounced which has wrongfully deprived him of something or

</p><p id="p_252">138.      The English judiciary was hesitant in applying this

broadened rule of standing to actions seeking remedy through

relator claims - Relator claims are remedies brought by the

Attorney General to remedy a breach of a public right. (e.g.,

declaration and injunction).             Initially, Lord Denning extended

the    broadened    rule     of   standing       in    actions     seeking       remedy

through prerogative writs to actions seeking remedy through

relator    claims.      In     Attorney     General         Ex   rel    McWhirter     v.

Independent Broadcasting Authority, (1973) Q.B. 629 the Court

stipulated that, "in the last resort, if the Attorney-General

refuses leave in a proper case, or improperly or unreasonably

delays in giving leave, or his machinery works too slowly,

then a member of the public who has a sufficient interest can

himself apply to the court." This rule was promptly overturned

by the House of Lords in Gouriet v. Union of Post Office

Workers [1978] A.C. 435.                In this case, the House of Lords

held    that   in    relator      claims,      the     Attorney        General    holds

absolute discretion in deciding whether to grant leave to a

case.     Thus, the English judiciary did not grant standing to

an individual seeking remedy through relator claims.


</p><p id="p_253">139.      Finally,    an     amendment      to   the    Rules      of    the    Supreme

Court     in   1978    through         Order     53     overcame        the     English

judiciary's     hesitation        in    applying        a    broadened         rule   of
standing to relator claims.                Order 53 applied the broadened

rule    of     standing     to   both    actions          seeking          remedy   through

prerogative writs and actions seeking remedy through relator

claims.      Rule 3(5) of Order 53 stipulates that the Court shall

not grant leave for judicial review "unless it considers that

the applicant has a sufficient interest in the matter to which

the applicant relates." - ORDER 53, RULES                      OF   THE   SUPT. CT. (1981).

Court explained that "fairness and justice are tests to be

applied"       when     determining      if     a    party           has     a   sufficient

rule    of     standing      embodied     in    Order          53,        individuals    can

challenge actions of public officials if they are found to

squarely       within      the   mandate       of    this           Constitution.          In
furtherance      of    this      objective,        the   South   African     legal

framework takes a favorable stance towards PIL by prescribing

broad rules of standing and relaxing pleading requirements.

ensure that constitutional rights are given the full measure

of    protection      to   which    they     are    entitled.     In   the    said

prepared by lay persons must be construed generously and in

the light most favourable to the litigant.                         Lay litigants

the water catchment area, the watercourse, reservoir and the

pipelines would get contaminated.           According to the court,

water    has   been   considered   source   of   life   in   this   world.

Without water there can be no life.           History bears testimony

that due to famine and scarcity of water, civilization have

vanished, green lands have turned into deserts and arid goes

completely destroying the life not any of human being, but

animal life as well.      Therefore, water, which is necessary for

litigation, procedural trappings and restrictions of being an

aggrieved person and other similar technical objections cannot

bar the jurisdiction of the court.                        The Supreme Court also

construction of a grid station allegedly located in the green-

belt of a residential locality.                      They pointed out that the

transmission lines at the grid station would pose a serious

health hazard to the residents of the area particularly the

dangerous to the citizens particularly the children who play
outside in the area.            It would damage the greenbelt and affect

the environment.             It was also alleged that it violates the

principles of planning in Islamabad where the green belts are

considered        an     essential              component        of       the      city      for

interest litigation.           Accordingly, the court has devised a

number of strategies to ensure that the attractive brand name

of public interest litigation should not be allowed to be used

for suspicious products of mischief.                     Firstly, the Supreme

Court   has    limited   standing     in   PIL      to       individuals      "acting

bonafide."      Secondly, the Supreme Court has sanctioned the

imposition     of    "exemplary     costs"     as        a    deterrent       against

frivolous and vexatious public interest litigations.                         Thirdly,

the Supreme Court has instructed the High Courts to be more

selective in entertaining the public interest litigations.


</p><p id="p_293">164.      In S. P. Gupta's case (supra), this Court has found

that this liberal standard makes it critical to limit standing

to   individuals     "acting   bona    fide.          To      avoid       entertaining

frivolous and vexatious petitions under the guise of PIL, the
Court    has        excluded    two   groups     of    persons      from   obtaining

standing       in    PIL     petitions.     First,      the    Supreme     Court    has

rejected       awarding        standing     to    "meddlesome           interlopers".

Second, the Court has denied standing to interveners bringing

public interest litigation for personal gain.


</p><p id="p_294">165.         In Chhetriya Pardushan Mukti Sangharsh Samiti (supra),

the Court withheld standing from the applicant on grounds that

the applicant brought the suit motivated by enmity between the

parties.           Thus, the Supreme Court has attempted to create a

body of jurisprudence that accords broad enough standing to

admit genuine PIL petitions, but nonetheless limits standing

to thwart frivolous and vexations petitions.


</p><p id="p_295">166.         The     Supreme     Court    broadly      tried       to   curtail     the

frivolous public interest litigation petitions by two methods

</p><p id="p_296">- one monetary and second, non-monetary.                       The first category

of cases is that where the court on filing frivolous public

interest litigation petitions, dismissed the petitions with

exemplary costs.              In Neetu v. State of Pubjab &amp; Others AIR

2007    SC    758,     the    Court   concluded       that    it   is   necessary   to

impose exemplary costs to ensure that the message goes in the

right direction that petitions filed with oblique motive do

not have the approval of the Courts.

moving the Court by not plunging in areas wherein they are not

well-versed.

2005 SC 2841, this Court went a step further by imposing a

monetary penalty against an Advocate for filing a frivolous

and vexatious PIL petition.                The Court found that the petition

was devoid of public interest, and instead labelled it as

"publicity interest litigation."                    Thus, the Court dismissed

the petition with costs of Rs.10,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_301">
</p><p id="p_302">169.      Similarly,      in    <a href="/doc/1529115/" id="a_153">Dattaraj         Nathuji    Thaware        v.   State   of

Maharashtra      &amp;    Others</a>      (2005)     1    SCC    590,   the    Supreme      Court

affirmed the High Court's monetary penalty against a member of

the Bar for filing a frivolous and vexatious PIL petition.

This   Court     found       that      the   petition       was       nothing     but     a

camouflage to foster personal dispute.                     Observing that no one

should be permitted to bring disgrace to the noble profession,

the Court concluded that the imposition of the penalty of Rs.

25,000 by the High Court was appropriate.                             Evidently, the

Supreme    Court       has      set       clear    precedent          validating        the

imposition       of    monetary         penalties        against       frivolous        and

vexatious PIL petitions, especially when filed by Advocates.


</p><p id="p_303">170.      This    Court,     in     the    second       category      of   cases,    even

passed harsher orders.                <a href="/doc/475079/" id="a_154">In Charan Lal Sahu &amp; Others v. Giani

Zail   Singh     &amp;    Another</a>     AIR     1984    SC    309,    the    Supreme      Court

observed that, "we would have been justified in passing a

heavy order of costs against the two petitioners" for filing a
"light-hearted     and    indifferent"    PIL     petition.     However,   to

prevent "nipping in the bud a well-founded claim on a future

occasion," the Court opted against imposing monetary costs on

the petitioners."          In this case, this Court concluded that

the    petition   was    careless,    meaningless,    clumsy    and    against

public interest.        Therefore, the Court ordered the Registry to

initiate prosecution proceedings against the petitioner under

the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_155">Contempt of Courts Act</a>.            Additionally, the court forbade

the Registry from entertaining any future PIL petitions filed

by the petitioner, who was an advocate in this case.

(1999) 1 SCC 53, this court laid down that public interest

litigation can be filed by any person challenging the misuse

or improper use of any public property including the political

party in power for the reason that interest of individuals

cannot    be   placed    above   or    preferred     to   a   larger   public

<p id="p_305">

not abused by any person for personal gain.


</p><p id="p_309">174.      In   Dattaraj     Nathuji     Thaware     (supra),    this    court
expressed its anguish on misuse of the forum of the court

under the garb of public interest litigation and observed that

the public interest litigation is a weapon which has to be

used with great care and circumspection and the judiciary has

to be extremely careful to see that behind the beautiful veil

of public interest, an ugly private malice, vested interest

and/or publicity seeking is not lurking.            It is to be used as

an   effective   weapon   in   the   armoury   of   law   for   delivering

social justice to the citizens.         The court must not allow its

process to be abused for oblique considerations.



</p><p id="p_310">175.     In Thaware's case (supra), the Court encouraged the

imposition of a non-monetary penalty against a PIL petition

filed by a member of the bar.            The Court directed the Bar

Councils and Bar Associations to ensure that no member of the

Bar becomes party as petitioner or in aiding and/or abetting

files frivolous petitions carrying the attractive brand name

of Public Interest Litigation.         This direction impels the Bar

Councils and Bar Associations to disbar members found guilty

of filing frivolous and vexatious PIL petitions.

<p id="p_313">177.     The malice of frivolous and vexatious petitions did not

originate in India.     The jurisprudence developed by the Indian

judiciary   regarding   the    imposition     of   exemplary   costs    upon

frivolous   and    vexatious    PIL    petitions    is    consistent    with

jurisprudence     developed    in   other   countries.       U.S.    Federal

Courts    and   Canadian      Courts   have    also      imposed    monetary

penalties upon public interest claims regarded as frivolous.

The courts also imposed non-monetary penalties upon Advocates

for filing frivolous claims.           In Everywoman's Health Centre

Society v. Bridges 54 B.C.L.R. (2nd Edn.) 294, the British

Columbia Court of Appeal granted special costs against the

Appellants for bringing a meritless appeal.


</p><p id="p_314">178.     U.S. Federal Courts too have imposed monetary penalties
against    plaintiffs         for       bringing    frivolous         public      interest

claims.         Rule   11    of    the    Federal      Rules     of   Civil      Procedure

("FRCP") permits Courts to apply an "appropriate sanction" on

any party for filing frivolous claims.                           Federal Courts have

relied     on     this      rule    to     impose        monetary      penalties        upon

frivolous public interest claims.                      For example, in Harris v.

Marsh 679 F.Supp. 1204 (E.D.N.C. 1987), the District Court for

the    Eastern     District        of    North    Carolina       imposed     a   monetary

sanction    upon       two   civil       rights     plaintiffs        for    bringing      a

frivolous, vexatious, and meritless employment discrimination

claim.          The Court explained that "the increasingly crowded

dockets of the federal courts cannot accept or tolerate the

heavy burden posed by factually baseless and claims that drain

judicial resources."               As a deterrent against such wasteful

claims,    the     Court      levied       a    cost     of     $83,913.62       upon    two

individual civil rights plaintiffs and their legal counsel for

abusing the judicial process.                   Case law in Canadian Courts and

U.S. Federal Courts exhibits that the imposition of monetary

penalties upon frivolous public interest claims is not unique

to Indian jurisprudence.
</p>
<p id="p_315">
</p><p id="p_316">179.      Additionally,           U.S.    Federal      Courts     have      imposed     non-

monetary    penalties         upon       Attorneys        for    bringing        frivolous

claims.     Federal rules and case law leave the door open for

such non-monetary penalties to be applied equally in private

claims    and     public     interest          claims.        Rule    11    of   the    FRCP

additionally permits Courts to apply an "appropriate sanction"

on Attorneys for filing frivolous claims on behalf of their
clients.         U.S.       Federal      Courts     have       imposed      non-monetary

sanctions upon Attorneys for bringing frivolous claims under

Rule 11.

Attorney     for      having      "brought    and    pressed      frivolous      claims,

made personal attacks on various government officials in bad

faith and for the purpose of harassment, and demonstrated a

lack of candor to, and contempt for, the court." This judicial

stance endorses the ethical obligation embodied in Rule 3.1 of

the Model Rules of Professional Conduct ("MRPC"): "a lawyer

shall     not    bring       or    defend     a     proceeding,        or     assert     or

controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law

and fact for doing so that is not frivolous."                            Together, the

FRCP,     U.S.       federal      case   law,      and    the    MRPC       endorse     the

imposition       of     non-monetary         penalties         upon    attorneys        for

bringing frivolous private claims or public interest claims.

essential       in    the    larger      public     interest.          To     arrest    the

mischief is the obligation and tribute to the judicial system.


</p><p id="p_320">182.      In SP Gupta (supra)             the court cautioned that important

jurisdiction of public interest litigation may be confined to

legal wrongs and legal injuries for a group of people or class
of   persons.        It   should    not   be   used   for    individual   wrongs

because individuals can always seek redress from legal aid

</p><p id="p_332">189.     When we revert to the facts of the present then the

conclusion is obvious that this case is a classic case of the

abuse of the process of the court.                        In the present case a

practicing lawyer has deliberately abused the process of the

court.      In that process, he has made a serious attempt to

demean   an      important     constitutional           office.      The    petitioner

ought to have known that the controversy which he has been
raising in the petition stands concluded half a century ago

and by a Division Bench judgment of Nagpur High Court in the

case    of   Karkare    (supra)   the   said   case   was   approved   by   a

Constitution Bench of this court.          The controversy involved in

this case is no longer res integra.              It is unfortunate that

even after such a clear enunciation of the legal position, a

large number of similar petitions have been filed from time to

time in various High Courts.             The petitioner ought to have

refrained from filing such a frivolous petition.


</p><p id="p_333">190.     A degree of precision and purity in presentation is a

sine qua non for a petition filed by a member of the Bar under

the label of public interest litigation.              It is expected from

a member of the Bar to at least carry out the basic research

whether the point raised by him is res integra or not.                  The

lawyer who files such a petition cannot plead ignorance.


</p><p id="p_334">191.     We would like to make it clear that we are not saying

that the petitioner cannot ask the court to review its own

judgment because of flaws and lacunae, but that should have

been a bona fide presentation with listing of all relevant

cases in a chronological order and that a brief description of

what judicial opinion has been and cogent and clear request

why    where   should   be   re-consideration    of   the   existing   law.

Unfortunately, the petitioner has not done this exercise.               The

petition which has been filed in the High Court is a clear

abuse of the process of law and we have no doubt that the

petition has been filed for extraneous considerations.                  The
petition      also    has   the   potentiality          of     demeaning          a    very

important constitutional office.                  Such petition deserves to

be discarded and discouraged so that no one in future would

attempt to file a similar petition.

circumstances of the case, we allow the appeals filed by the

State and quash the proceedings of the Civil Miscellaneous

Writ Petition No. 689 (M/B) of 2001 filed in the Uttaranchal

High Court.      We further direct that the respondents (who were

the    petitioners      before    the    High        Court)    to     pay       costs    of

Rs.1,00,000/-        (Rupees   One     Lakh)    in     the     name       of    Registrar

General of the High court of Uttarakhand.                           The costs to be

paid by the respondents           within two months.                If the costs is

not deposited within two months, the same would be recovered

as the arrears of the Land Revenue.

Court to create a fund in the name of Uttarakhand High Court

Lawyers Welfare Fund if not already in existence.                                The fund

could be utilized for providing necessary help to deserving

young    lawyers       by   the   Chief        Justice        of    Uttarakhand         in

consultation with the President of the Bar.


</p><p id="p_339">194.     We    must    abundantly       make    it    clear        that    we    are    not

discouraging     the    public    interest       litigation         in     any    manner,

what we are trying to curb is its misuse and abuse. According

to us, this is a very important branch and, in a large number

of PIL petitions, significant directions have been given by
the     courts      for     improving   ecology    and     environment,         and

directions helped in preservation of forests, wildlife, marine

life etc. etc.            It is the bounden duty and obligation of the

courts to encourage genuine bona fide PIL petitions and pass

directions and orders in the public interest which are in

consonance with the Constitution and the Laws.


</p><p id="p_340">195.      The    Public      Interest   Litigation,      which    has    been    in

existence in our country for more than four decades, has a

glorious record.            This Court and the High Courts by their

judicial creativity and craftsmanship have passed a number of

directions in the larger public interest in consonance with

the inherent spirits of the Constitution.                 The conditions of

marginalized         and     vulnerable    section       of      society     have

significantly improved on account of courts directions in the

P.I.L.
</p>
<p id="p_341">
</p><p id="p_342">196.      In our considered view, now it has become imperative to

streamline the P.I.L.
</p>
<p id="p_343">
</p><p id="p_344">197.      We have carefully considered the facts of the present

case.     We have also examined the law declared by this court

and other courts in a number of judgments.
</p>
<p id="p_345">

</p><p id="p_346">198.      In order to preserve the purity and sanctity of the

PIL,     it   has     become     imperative   to     issue       the    following

directions:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_55">       (1)    The courts must encourage genuine and bona fide
              PIL and effectively discourage and curb the PIL
              filed for extraneous considerations.
</blockquote><p id="p_347">       (2)   Instead of every individual judge devising his
             own procedure for dealing with the public
             interest litigation, it would be appropriate for
             each High Court to properly formulate rules for
             encouraging the genuine PIL and discouraging the
             PIL filed with oblique motives.    Consequently,
             we request that the High Courts who have not yet
             framed the rules, should frame the rules within
             three months.    The Registrar General of each
             High Court is directed to ensure that a copy of
             the Rules prepared by the High Court is sent to
             the Secretary General of this court immediately
             thereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_348">       (3)   The courts should prima facie verify the
             credentials    of     the petitioner before
             entertaining a P.I.L.
</p>
<p id="p_349">       (4)   The court should be prima facie satisfied
             regarding the correctness of the contents of the
             petition before entertaining a PIL.
</p>
<p id="p_350">       (5)   The court should be fully satisfied that
             substantial public interest is involved before
             entertaining the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_351">       (6)   The court should ensure that the petition which
             involves larger public interest, gravity and
             urgency must be given priority over other
             petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_352">       (7)   The courts before entertaining the PIL should
             ensure that the PIL is aimed at redressal of
             genuine public harm or public injury.         The
             court should also ensure that there is no
             personal gain, private motive or oblique motive
             behind filing the public interest litigation.

       (8)   The court should also ensure that the petitions
             filed by busybodies for extraneous and ulterior
             motives   must  be   discouraged  by   imposing
             exemplary costs or by adopting similar novel
             methods to curb frivolous petitions and the
             petitions filed for extraneous considerations.
