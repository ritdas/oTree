</p>
<p id="p_5">Thereafter, a Misc. Case, being Misc. Case No. 21387 of 2012 has

been filed by the opp. party no. 4 in the writ petition to vacate the

interim order passed on 13.12.2012. Misc. Case No. 21469 of

2012 has been filed by some of the villagers of Ekagharia under

Samal Barrage, Kaniha Police Station in the district of Angul for

intervening in the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.            W.P. (C) No. 1066 of 2013 has been filed by the

persons, who have filed the intervention application in W.P. (C) No.

23228 of 2012 as a separate writ petition bringing to the notice of

the Court the further developments in the matter and praying to

declare the joint verification report under Annexure-9 dated

15.11.2012 as illegal and consent order dated 16.11.2012 issued

to the opp. party no. 4 also as illegal and to quash the same.

</p><p id="p_7">5.            Facts disclose that the opp. party no. 4 has a Coal

Tar Refinery unit at Ekagharia in the district of Angul and

produces Coal Tar and other industrial chemicals as bi-products.

The main objection of the petitioners with regard to running of the

said unit is that, the said unit       without adhering to the pollution

control norms being allowed to run is causing heavy pollution in

the area endangering the lives and properties of the people of the

locality. It has been brought to the notice of the Court that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>

petitioner in W.P. (C) No. 23228 of 2012 also moved the Green

Tribunal on 13.12.2012 when this Court passed the interim order.

</p><p id="p_8">6.            Mr. Rath, learned senior counsel appearing for the

opp. party no. 4 vehemently urged that the petitioner having

sought for similar remedies before two forums, i.e., this Court as

well as the Green Tribunal at Delhi, the writ petition is not

maintainable. He further submitted that the petitioner having

suppressed the said fact before this Court, on that score also, the

writ petition should be dismissed. However, considering the

nature of allegations made in the writ petition, we proposed to

hear the writ petition on merits.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.            Mr. A.A. Das, learned counsel for the petitioner in

W.P. (C) No. 23228 of 2012 submitted that the State Pollution

Control Board on 1.6.2012 under Annexure-3 intimated the opp.

party no. 4 that the unit was allowed to operate on a trial basis for

a period of three months on 7.5.2012 with some specific

conditions to comply within a time frame. The opp. party no. 4

intimated on 15.5.2012 that it has complied with the condition

nos. 5, 6 and 7. After receiving a number of public complaints, the

plant was inspected on 25.5.2012 by the Officials of the State

Pollution Control Board. During such inspection, it was observed

that the plant was in operation in a full-fledged manner and the

opp. party no. 4 has failed to comply with most of the conditions

imposed in the above trial run order. The same being in violation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  5</span>

of the order under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_2">26</a> of the Water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_4">Section 21</a> of the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and further, the

opp. party no. 4 having given false information to the Board that it

has complied with the conditions, it attracts the penal provision

under <a href="/doc/143812071/" id="a_6">section 42</a> (f) of the      Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/159581089/" id="a_8">section 38</a> (f) of the Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. Basing on the said inspection

report, the Regional Officer of the State Pollution Control Board

directed the opp. party no. 4 to stop operation of the plant

forthwith till compliance of all the conditions imposed in the trial

run order is made and report of compliance is submitted to the

Regional Officer with immediate effect. According to Mr. Das,

basing on the said order, the interim order dated 13.12.2012 was

passed. He further contended that till date, the opp. party no. 4

having not complied with the same, it should not be allowed to

run the unit as the pollution caused by the said unit is

endangering the lives of the people living in the locality.

</p><p id="p_10">8.            A counter affidavit has been filed by the State

Pollution Control Board, inter alia, stating that after receipt of the

order of this Court dated 13.12.2012, a letter dated 17.12.2012

was issued to the opp. party no. 4 directing to stop operation of its

Coal Tar Refinery unit. To further ensure stoppage of operation,

the said unit was sealed on 19.12.2012 by the Executive
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  6</span>

Magistrate, Kaniha in presence of other authorities. This fact was

intimated to the Member, Secretary of the State Pollution Control

Board by letter dated 20.12.2012. The Green Tribunal by order

dated13.12.2012 directed the Collector and District Magistrate,

Angul to implement the order dated 1.6.2012 by the Pollution

Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.            It appears from the Misc. Case filed for vacation of

interim order by the opp. party no. 4 as well as the annexures

made to W.P. (C) No. 1066 of 2013           that on 10.10.2012, the

Regional Officer of the State Pollution Control Board, Regional

Office   noticed the opp. party no. 4 intimating it that for the

purpose of making an enquiry         under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_10">sections 25</a> and      <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_11">26</a>, the

assist them shall inspect     the water work, Sewage Work, Water

conducted and a joint inspection was also conducted by the

<p id="p_28">11.          After hearing learned counsel for the parties and on

perusal of the documents produced in        both the writ petitions

and further considering the above developments, we dispose of

both the writ petitions directing the authorities of the State

Pollution Control Board - opp. party no. 2 to make a fresh

inspection of the    unit of the petitioner within a period of two

weeks hence in order to find out as to how far the opp. party no. 4

has proceeded in fulfilling the conditions mentioned in the

consent letter dated 16.11.2012 and further inspecting as to

whether any pollution is being caused by the said unit, either air

or water as per the pollution control norms. If they find that the

opp. party no. 4 has proceeded to fulfil the conditions imposed

in the said letter dated 16.11.2012 to some extent and         they
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                 10</span>

expect that the opp. Party no. 4       shall be able to fulfil all the

conditions fully by 31.3.2013 till which time they were allowed to

operate the unit and further at present, there is no pollution

caused by the unit or the pollution which is caused (air or water)

will not endanger the lives and properties of the people residing

nearby taking note of the distance and natural barriers, if any,

between the industry and the nearest habitats , they shall grant

a fresh consent letter to the opp. party no. 4 allowing it          to

operate the unit. However, during inspection, if it is found that

the unit causes such pollution, both air and water, which is

beyond the limits prescribed in the aforesaid Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1986 and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_14">Water (Prevention of

Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, such permission to run the unit

shall not be granted by them to the opp. party no. 4 till they fulfil

the   conditions   enumerated     in   the   consent    letter   dated

16.11.2012. This Court further observes that as the order passed

by the Regional Office of the State Pollution Control Board is

appealable before the Appellate Authority, any party aggrieved by

the order to be passed by the opp. party no. 2 pursuant to the

above directions may prefer an appeal as provided under the Acts.

It is needless to mention that for the purpose of inspection, the

opp. party no. 4 shall be permitted to operate the unit during the

course of inspection.
