passed on the basis of complaint lodged upon the Chief
Minister Helpline on 17.02.2018; on the back of the
petitioner, a Team was constituted and without giving
any show cause notice to the petitioner, the impugned
order has been passed in violation to the principles of
natural justice; and prays for its quashment.
</p><p id="p_2">2.   The alleged impugned order dated 23.02.2018
(Annexure P/5) has been passed by Madhya Pradesh

sel for respondents No.1 to 3 has submitted that a
complaint has been filed on grievance portal in the
name of CM Help Line against the petitioner alleging
cause of pollution due to industrial activity of the peti­
tioner. Upon such complaint, an inspection has been
carried out on 22.02.2018 by an employee (Scientist)
of the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board, who
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             3</span>


has submitted a report to the effect that the industry of
the petitioner is being run in the residential area, and
therefore, issuance of notices under the provisions of
Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974
and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981

Paryavaran Suraksha Samiti and another v.

newspaper Dainik Bhaskar on 16.03.2018 whereby the
above order of Hon'ble Supreme Court has been in­

the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board are just,
proper and legal, as the petitioner has been running
the industry, without obtaining mandatory consent un­

No.375/<a href="/doc/190799178/" id="a_15">2012 Paryavaran Suraksha Samiti and
another v. Union of India &amp; others</a> reads, as un­
der: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "4.    The question that arises for our consideration
     is, whether the same is maintained in good order, af­
     ter the industry itself has become functional. The in­
     dustry requiring "consent to operate", can be permit­
     ted to run, only if its primary effluent treatment
     plant, is functional. We therefore consider it just and
     appropriate, to direct the concerned State Pollution
     Control Boards, to issue notices to all industrial
     units, which require "consent to operate", by way of a
     common advertisement, requiring them to make
     their primary effluent treatment plants fully opera­
     tional, within three months from today. On the ex­
     piry of the notice period of three months, the con­
     cerned State Pollution Control Board(s) are mandat­
     ed to carry out inspections, to verify, whether or not,
     each industrial unit requiring "consent to operate",
     has a functional primary effluent treatment plant.
     Such of the industrial units, which have not been able
     to make their primary effluent treatment plant fully
     operational, within the notice period, shall be re­
     strained from any further industrial activity. This di­
     rection may be implemented by requiring the con­
     cerned electricity supply and distribution agency, to
     disconnect the electricity connection of the default­
     ing industry. We therefore hereby further direct, that
     in case the concerned State Pollution Control Boards
     make a recommendation to the concerned electrical
     supply and distribution agency/company, to discon­
     nect electricity supply to an industry, for the reason
     that its primary effluent treatment plant is not func­
     tional, it shall honour such recommendation, and
     shall disconnect the electricity supply to such de­
     faulting industrial concern, forthwith.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     5.     Such an industrial concern, which has been
     disabled from carrying on its industrial activities, as
     has been indicated in the foregoing paragraph, is
     granted liberty to make its primary effluent
     treatment plant functional to the required capacity,
     and thereupon, seek a fresh "consent to operate"</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">     from the concerned Pollution Control Board. Only
     after the receipt of such fresh "consent to operate",
     the industrial activities of the disabled industry, can
     be permitted to be resumed. In carrying out the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             5</span>


above exercise, we consider it just and appropriate to
require, the Pollution Control Boards to carry out
inspections, by prioritizing inspections of severely
and critically polluted industries, so that visible
results emerge at the earliest.
</p><p id="p_9">6.    Liberty is hereby granted to private
individual(s) and organizations, to address
complaints to the concerned Pollution Control
Board, if any industry is in default. On the receipt of
any such complaint, the concerned Pollution Control
Board, shall be obliged to verify the same, and take
such action against the defaulting industry, as may
be permissible in law. Such action, would be in
addition to the discontinuation of industrial activity
forthwith, in the manner directed herein above (but
only after verification).
</p><p id="p_10">7.    Having effectuated the directions recorded in
the foregoing paragraphs, the next step would be, to
set up common effluent treatment plants. We are
informed, that for the aforesaid purpose, the
financial contribution of the Central Government is
to the extent of 50 per cent, that of the concerned
State Government (including the concerned Union
Territory) is 25 per cent. The balance 25 per cent, is
to be arranged by way of loans from banks. The
above loans, are to be repaid, by the industrial areas,
and/or industrial clusters. We are also informed, that
the setting up of a common effluent treatment plant,
would ordinarily take approximately two years (in
cases where the process has yet to be commenced).
The reason for the above prolonged period, for
setting up "common effluent treatment plants",
according to learned counsel, is not only financial,
but also, the requirement of land acquisition, for the
same.
</p><p id="p_11">8.    In view of the fact, that the financial position
has been taken care of, as has been expressed above,
we are of the view, that the setting up of "common
effluent treatment plants", should be taken up as an
urgent mission. With reference to common effluent
treatment plants, which are already under
implementation, we hope and expect, that they
would be completed within the time lines already
postulated. With reference to common effluent
treatment plants, which are yet to be set up, we
consider it just and appropriate to direct, the
concerned State Governments (including, the
concerned Union Territories) to complete the same
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             6</span>


within a period of three years, from today. We are
also of the view, that while acquiring land for the
'common effluent treatment plants', the concerned
State Governments (including, the concerned Union
Territories) will acquire such additional land, as may
be required for setting up "zero liquid discharge
plants", if and when required in the future.
</p><p id="p_12">9.     During the course of hearing, we were
informed by learned counsel, that the running of
'common effluent treatment plants', which are in
place, is also a matter of serious concern. In this
behalf, it was submitted, that some of the common
effluent treatment plants are dis- functional, because
of lack of finances, whilst some others are dis-
functional, because of the requirement of repairs,
which have not been carried out, again because of
lack of financial resources.
</p><p id="p_13">10. Given        the     responsibility    vested    in
Municipalities under <a href="/doc/452231/" id="a_16">Article 243</a> W of the
Constitution, as also, in item 6 of the 12th Schedule,
wherein the aforesaid obligation, pointedly extends
to "public health, sanitation conservancy and solid
waste management", we are of the view, that the
onus to operate the existing common effluent
treatment plants, rests on municipalities (and/or
local bodies). Given the aforesaid responsibility, the
concerned municipalities (and/or local bodies),
cannot be permitted to shy away, from discharging
this onerous duty. In case there are further financial
constraints, the remedy lies in Articles 243X and
243Y of the Constitution. It will be open to the
concerned municipalities(and/or local bodies), to
evolve norms to recover funds, for the purpose of
generating finances to install and run, all the
"common effluent treatment plants", within the
purview of the provisions referred to herein above.
Needless to mention, that such norms as may be
evolved for generating financial resources, may
include all or any, of the commercial, industrial and
domestic beneficiaries, of the facility. The process of
evolving the above norms, shall be supervised by the
concerned State Government (Union Territory),
through the Secretaries, Urban Development and
Local Bodies respectively, (depending on the location
of the respective common effluent treatment plant).
The norms for generating funds, for setting up
and/or operating the 'common effluent treatment
plant' shall be finalized, on or before 31.03.2017, so
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                             7</span>


as to be implemented with effect from the next
financial year. In case, such norms are not in place,
before the commencement of the next financial year,
the concerned State Governments (or the Union
Territories), shall cater to the financial requirements,
of running the "common effluent treatment plants",
which are presently dis- functional, from their own
financial resources.
</p><p id="p_14">11.    Just in the manner suggested herein above, for
the purpose of setting up of "common effluent
treatment plants", the concerned State Governments
(including, the concerned Union Territories) will
prioritize such cities, towns and villages, which
discharge industrial pollutants and sewer, directly
into rivers and water bodies.
</p><p id="p_15">12. We are of the view, that in the manner
suggested above, the malady of sewer treatment,
should also be dealt with simultaneously. We
therefore hereby direct, that 'sewage treatment
plants' shall also be set up and made functional,
within the time lines and the format, expressed
herein above.
</p><p id="p_16">13. We are of the view, that mere directions are
inconsequential, unless a rigid implementation
mechanism is laid down. We therefore hereby
provide, that the directions pertaining to
continuation of industrial activity only when there is
in place a functional "primary effluent treatment
plants", and the setting up of functional "common
effluent treatment plants" within the time lines,
expressed above, shall be of the Member Secretaries
of the concerned Pollution Control Boards. The
Secretary of the Department of Environment, of the
concerned State Government (and the concerned
Union Territory), shall be answerable in case of
default. The concerned Secretaries to the
Government shall be responsible of monitoring the
progress, and issuing necessary directions to the
concerned Pollution Control Board, as may be
required, for the implementation of the above
directions. They shall be also responsible for
collecting and maintaining records of data, in respect
of the directions contained in this order. The said
data shall be furnished to the Central Ground Water
Authority, which shall evaluate the data, and shall
furnish the same to the Bench of the jurisdictional
National Green Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_17">14.   To     supervise      complaints      of     non-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  8</span>


<p id="p_18">     implementation of the instant directions, the
     concerned Benches of the National Green Tribunal,
     will maintain running and numbered case files, by
     dividing the jurisdictional area into units. The above
     mentioned case files, will be listed periodically. The
     concerned Pollution Control Board is also hereby
     directed, to initiate such civil or criminal action, as
     may be permissible in law, against all or any of the
     defaulters.
</p><p id="p_19">     15.   Liberty is granted to private individuals, and
     organizations, to approach the concerned Bench of
     the jurisdictional National Green Tribunal, for
     appropriate orders, by pointing out deficiencies, in
     implementation of the above directions.
</p><p id="p_20">     16. It however needs to be clarified, that the
     instant directions and time lines, shall not in any way
     dilute any time lines and directions issued by Courts
     or Benches of the National Green Tribunal, hitherto
     before, wherein the postulated time lines would
     expire before the ones expressed through the
     directions recorded above. It is clarified, that the
     time lines, expressed herein above will be relevant,
     only in situations where there are no prevalent time
     line(s), and also, where a longer period, has been
     provided for.
</p><p id="p_21">     17.    It would be in the interest of implementation
     of the objective sought to be achieved, to also require
     each concerned State(and each, concerned Union
     Territory) to make provision for "online, real time,
     continuous monitoring system" to display emission
     levels, in the public domain, on the portal of the
     concerned State Pollution Control Board. We are
     informed, that at least three State Governments have
     already adopted the aforesaid measures. Such
     measures shall be put in place by all the concerned
     State Governments( including, the concerned Union
     Territories), within six months from today.
</p><p id="p_22">     18. The instant writ petition stands disposed of, in
     the aforesaid terms."
</p><p id="p_23">8.   His submission is that action has been taken
against the petitioner's unit in compliance to order
passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 22.02.2017.
Photographs annexed by the writ petitioner with writ
petition as Annexure P/4 establish the emission of pol­

lutants, smoke etc. through the installed chimney and
exhaust; and prayed for dismissal of the writ petition.
</p><p id="p_24">9.   Shri Vijay Sharma, learned counsel for respon­
dent No.6 / Indore Municipal Corporation also sup­
ported the action of the Madhya Pradesh Pollution
Control Board and submitted that unit of the petition­
er is situated in residential area; and in residential
area, no industrial unit is permissible. In the present
case, the petitioner, without taking No Objection Cer­
tificate from Indore Municipal Corporation, Indore has
started the industrial unit, and therefore, Madhya
Pradesh Pollution Control Board has not committed
any legal error in passing the impugned order.
</p><p id="p_25">10. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has
drawn our attention to various provisions and submit­
ted that under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_17">Section 25</a> (5) of Water (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, notice is must. The im­
pugned order dated 23.02.2018 has been passed with­
out proper enquiry and investigation.        He has also
drawn our attention to decision of the Apex Court in
the case of Harbanslal Sahnai v. Indian Old
Corporation Limited reported in AIR 2003 SC
2120 and in the case of M/s. Allied Motors Limit­
ed v. M/s. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Lim­
ited reported in AIR 2012 SC 709; and submitted
that rule of exclusion of writ jurisdiction by availability
of alternative remedy is rule of discretion and not one
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                      10</span>


                         of compulsion. Admittedly, the impugned order was
                         passed without giving show cause notice and giving an
                         opportunity of hearing; and thus, there is violation of
