HONBLE SRI JUSTICE C. PRAVEEN KUMAR         


CRIMINAL PETITION No.12527 OF 2013     


ORDER :  
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Questioning the order dated 09.10.2013 passed by the
learned IX Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,
Hyderabad, wherein and whereunder, permission was granted  
to the police to conduct investigation for the offences
punishable under <a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_1">Sections 504</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_2">506</a> and <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_3">120-B</a> IPC which are 
non-cognizable, this Criminal petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_4">Section
482</a> of Criminal Procedure Code seeking quashing of the same 
on the ground that the said order was passed without
application of mind.
</p><p id="p_2">      The facts in issue are as under :
</p><p id="p_3">      On 08.10.2013 at about 2.30 p.m., the Sub-Inspector of
Police, Narayanaguda Police Station, received a complaint
from one Musunuri Srinivasa Rao, R/o.Flat No.505, H.No.
3-6-69, Venkatarama Towers, Basheerbagh, in which he  
alleged that his ex-employee S. Purnachandra Rao and 
S.Rajesh Kiran (petitioners herein) bore grudge against him
and started threatening him with dire consequences if
subsequent amount was not paid to them.  He also suspects  
movement of suspicious persons around his Office.  In view of
the imminent threat to his life, a report was lodged before the
Narayanguda Police Station, seeking action against the
culprits.
</p><p id="p_4">      Pursuant to the said report the Sub-Inspector of Police,
Narayanaguda Police, requested the IX Additional Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad, to accord permission to
register the crime for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_5">Sections
504</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_6">506</a>, <a href="/doc/1128948/" id="a_7">120</a> B IPC, as the above offences are non-
cognizable in nature.  By an order, dated 09.10.2013 the
learned Magistrate accorded permission to conduct
investigation for the above mentioned offences.  Challenging
the said order, the present application is filed.
</p><p id="p_5">      Relying upon the Judgments of the Apex Court in Anil
Kumar and Others Vs M.K. Aiyappa and another , Sajjal 
Agarwal Vs State of Andhra Pradesh and another , 
Medwin Hospitals, rep., by its M.D., B. Kameswara Rao 
Vs State of A.P., Pollution Control Board , Assistant
Commissioner, Commercial Tax Department, Works    
Contract and Leasing Kota Vs Shukla and Brothers , 
Union Bank of India and others Vs Jai Prakash Singh
and another , the learned counsel for the petitioner
strenuously contends that reasons are to be recorded
showing application of mind while directing the police to
investigate into the non-cognizable offences under <a href="/doc/1062869/" id="a_8">Section
155</a> (2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_9">Cr.P.C</a>., failing which great prejudice would be caused
to the accused.
</p><p id="p_6">      Relying upon the Judgments of the Apex Court in Kanti
Bhadra Shah &amp; another Vs State of West Bengal , and  
Kunhumuhammed Vs State of Kerala   the learned counsel   
for the respondent would contend that no reasons are
necessary while granting permission to register a crime.
According to him, the reference made under <a href="/doc/833310/" id="a_10">Section 156</a> (3)
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11">Cr.P.C</a>., and the permission granted under <a href="/doc/1062869/" id="a_12">Section 155</a> (2)
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_13">Cr.P.C</a>., are quite distinct and different in nature. He
strenuously contends that reasons are required to be given
while refusing to give permission to register a crime and not
while granting permission to register a crime.  He further
submits that the impugned order shows application of mind
while granting permission to register the crime and as such,
the same warrants no interference from this Court under
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_14">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_7">      The point for consideration is whether the impugned
order warrants interference of the Court for not giving reasons
while directing the police to investigate a non-cognizable
offence.
</p><p id="p_8">      In Anil Kumar and others Vs M.K.Aiyappa and
another, the Apex Court while dealing with a reference made
under <a href="/doc/833310/" id="a_15">Section 156</a> (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_16">Cr.P.C</a>., observed as under :
</p><p id="p_9">10.     We may first examine whether the Magistrate,
        while exercising his powers under <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_17">Section 156</a> (3)
        <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_18">Cr.P.C</a>., could act in a mechanical or casual manner
        and go on with the complaint after getting the
        report.
</p><p id="p_10">11.     The scope of <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_19">Section 156</a> (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_20">Cr.P.C</a>., came up for
consideration before this Court in several cases.
This Court in Maksud Saiyed Case examined the  
requirement of the application of mind by the
Magistrate before exercising jurisdiction under
<a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_21">Section 156</a> (3) and held that where jurisdiction is
exercised on a complaint filed in terms of <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_22">Section
156</a> (3) or <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_23">Section 200</a> Cr.P.C, the Magistrate is
required to apply his mind, in such a case, the
Special Judge/Magistrate cannot refer the matter
under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_24">Section 156(3)</a> against a public servant
without a valid sanction order.  The application of
mind by the Magistrate should be reflected in the
order.  The mere statement that he has gone
through the complaint, documents and heard the 
complainant, as such, as reflected in the order, will
not be sufficient.  After going through the complaint,
documents and hearing the complainant, what 
weighed with the Magistrate to order investigation
under <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_25">Section 156</a> (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_26">CrPC</a>, should be reflected in
the order, though a detailed expression of his views,
is neither required nor warranted.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      From the Judgment referred to above, it is clear that the
learned Magistrate, while referring the case under <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_27">Section
156</a> (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_28">Cr.P.C</a>., or while taking cognizance of the offence,
should give some reasons for passing the order, though it is
not necessary to pass a reasoned order.
</p><p id="p_12">       In Medwin Hospitals, rep., by its M.D., B.
</p><p id="p_13">Kameswara Rao Vs State of A.P., Pollution Control Board, 
a learned single Judge of this Court, while considering the
issue as to the nature of order to be passed while taking
cognizance of the matter held as under :
</p><p id="p_14"> There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever to hold that
criminal law cannot be set in motion against an accused
person in a very casual and mechanical manner.  The
Magistrate before taking cognizance is duty bound to
meticulously peruse the contents of the complaint so as to
satisfy himself that such contents do reveal the
commission of offence as alleged.  The question of issuing
a process does not arise without the learned Magistrate
forming an opinion based on the material available at the
time of taking cognizance.  The learned Magistrate is
required to not only look into the contents of the
complaint but also statement of the complainant and the
witnesses, if any, examined and other material including
the documents made available by the complainant.  Such 
application of mind is a condition precedent for issuing a
process against the accused.  It is well settled that issuing
process in a criminal case against an accused itself is
fraught with serious consequence.  But in my considered
opinion, it is not necessary for the learned Magistrate to
pass an elaborate order disclosing as to why he intends to
take cognizance of a case.  It would meet the requirement
of law, if the proceedings on the file of the learned
Magistrate would disclose the application of mind.  After
all, the learned Magistrate is not deciding any case at
that stage.  All that is required is that he has to satisfy
himself that the contents of the complaint prima facie
reveal the commission of the alleged offence.  The learned
Magistrate in the instant case passed the following order :
</p>
<p id="p_15">Perused the complaint. Case is taken on file for the
offence 43 &amp; 44 r/w.24, 25 and 26 of the Water Prevention
and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_29">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 against the accused.
Issue summons against the accused. Call on 21.8.96. 
</p>
<p id="p_16">The same would disclose application of mind, though it
would have been advisable for the learned Magistrate  to
indicate that the complaint discloses the commission of
the alleged offence.  However, it is required to observe that
the learned Magistrate could have been somewhat 
articulate in recording his satisfaction.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      In Sajjal Aggarwal  Vs State of Andhra Pradesh, a
learned Judge of this Court while dealing with an issue which
is identical to the case on hand held as under :
It is open to the Magistrate either to grant permission or
refuse to grant permission.  When there is such discretion
vested in the Magistrate, it is desirable that the
Magistrate should give reasons for empowering a police
officer to investigate a non-cognizable case, so that an
aggrieved party will be in a position to question the same
in higher Courts and will be in a position to know for what
reasons his application is considered or not considered.
</p>
<p id="p_18">       In view of the above, the learned counsel for the
petitioners would submit that giving reasons, while granting
permission to the police to investigate into non-cognizable
offence, is mandatory.
</p><p id="p_19">      Drawing an analogy from the Judgments of the Apex
Court in Kanti Bhadra Shah and another Vs State of
West Bengal, the learned counsel for the respondents
submits that no reasons are required to be recorded while
referring the case to the police for investigation into a non-
cognizable offence.  It was a case where the Apex Court dealt
with <a href="/doc/897083/" id="a_30">Sections 239</a> and <a href="/doc/1568411/" id="a_31">245</a> Cr.P.C.  The question before the
Court was whether the reasons are to be recorded while
framing a charge against the accused.  Dealing with the said
aspect, the Apex Court after referring to <a href="/doc/897083/" id="a_32">Sections 239</a> and <a href="/doc/150946/" id="a_33">240</a>
Cr.P.C., held as under :
</p><p id="p_20">10.    It is pertinent to note that this section requires a
Magistrate to record his reasons for discharging the
accused but there is no such requirement if he forms
the opinion that there is ground for presuming that
the accused had committed the offence which he is 
competent to try.  In such a situation he is only
required to frame a charge in writing against the
accused. 
</p>
<p id="p_21">      Further, a reading of <a href="/doc/897083/" id="a_34">Sections 239</a> and <a href="/doc/150946/" id="a_35">240</a> Cr.P.C.,
makes it clear that both the sections refer to recording of
reasons only if the Magistrate considers the charge against
the accused is groundless or where no case has been made  
out against the accused.
</p><p id="p_22">      Therefore, the argument of the learned counsel for the
respondents that reasons are to be recorded only when the
Court refuses to give permission to register a crime cannot be
accepted.  Further, as stated above, <a href="/doc/897083/" id="a_36">Sections 239</a> and <a href="/doc/150946/" id="a_37">240</a>
Cr.P.C., speak of recording reasons while allowing the
application for discharge filed by the accused.
</p><p id="p_23">      Learned counsel for the respondents would further
contend that giving reasons while referring the case to the
police under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_38">Section 156</a> (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_39">Cr.P.C</a>., is different from granting
permission under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_40">Section 155</a> (2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_41">Cr.P.C</a>., for registering a
non-cognizable offence. The said argument cannot be
accepted for the reason that the words used in <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_42">Section 156</a> (3)
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_43">Cr.P.C</a>., and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_44">Section 155</a> (2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_45">Cr.P.C</a>., are Order of a
Magistrate and may order such investigation. It may be
relevant to extract <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_46">Section 155</a> (2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_47">Cr.P.C</a>. and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_48">Section 156</a> (3)
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_49">Cr.P.C</a>., which read as under :
</p><p id="p_24"><a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_50">Section 155</a>: Information as to non- cognizable cases and
investigation of such cases.
</p><p id="p_25">(2) No police officer shall investigate a non- cognizable case
without the order of a Magistrate having power to try such
case or commit the case for trial.
</p><p id="p_26"><a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_51">Section 156</a>: Police officer' s power to investigate cognizable
case.
</p><p id="p_27">(3) Any Magistrate empowered under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_52">section 190</a> may order  
such an investigation as above- mentioned.
</p>
<p id="p_28">      A reading of the above two provisions clearly disclose
that a police officer cannot initiate any action without an
order of a Magistrate having power to try the case. Cause of
action in both the situations arise only after an order from the
Magistrate.
</p><p id="p_29">      Neither<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_53"> the Criminal Procedure Code</a> nor<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_54"> the Indian
Penal Code</a> define the word Order.  Oxford English
Dictionary, Second Edition, Vol.X defines Order as :
</p><p id="p_30">23.a. An authoritative directions, injunction, mandate; a
command, oral or written; an instruction.
</p><p id="p_31">24.spc. A. Law. A decision of a court or judge, made or
entered in writing ; in the Supreme Court, a direction
of the court or a judge other than a final judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_32">      FERDICOs Criminal Law and Justice Dictionary defines
Order as under :
</p><p id="p_33">      To issue a command or instruction.  A mandate,
command or direction issued by a judicial officer in exercise
of judicial authority and entered in Court record.
</p><p id="p_34">      Therefore the word Order; in <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_55">Section 155</a> (2) and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_56">Section 156</a> (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_57">Cr.P.C</a>., cannot be lost sight of as the same
assume lot of significance.   It is always said that reasons are
the lifelines of an order.
</p><p id="p_35">      Dealing with the importance of giving reasons while
passing orders, the Apex Court in Assistant Commissioner,
Commercial Tax Department Works Contract and Leasing,   
Kota Vs Shukla and Brothers held as under :
</p><p id="p_36">A litigant who approaches the court with any grievance in
accordance with law is entitled to know the reasons for grant
or rejection of his prayer.  Reasons are the soul of orders. Non-
recording of reasons could lead to dual infirmities; firstly, it
may cause prejudice to the affected party and secondly, more
particularly, hamper the proper administration of justice.
These principles are not only applicable to administrative or
executive actions, but they apply with equal force and, in fact,
with a greater degree of precision to judicial pronouncements.
A judgment without reasons causes prejudice to the person
against whom it is pronounced, as that litigant is unable to
know the ground which weighed with the court in rejecting
his claim and also causes impediments in his taking adequate
and appropriate grounds before the higher court in the event
of challenge to that judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_37">      Further, under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_58">Section 155</a> (2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_59">Cr.P.C</a>., it is always open
to the Magistrate either to grant permission or refuse to grant
permission. When such a discretion is vested in the
Magistrate, it is desirable that the Magistrate shall give
reasons while empowering the police officer to investigate into
a non-cognizable offence, so that the aggrieved person will be
in a position to know the reason for acceptance or rejection of
his application, otherwise there is every possibility of misuse
of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_60">Section 155</a> (2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_61">Cr.P.C</a>.  In case such a power is given to a
police officer, he may misuse his official position and harass
the accused person (Sajjal Aggarwal  Vs State of Andhra
Pradesh).
</p><p id="p_38">      In Tilaknagar Industries Ltd., and Others Vs State
of A.P., and another ,  State of Haryana and Others Vs
Bhajan Lal and Others , the Apex Court held that the
statutory safeguard given under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_62">Section 155</a> (2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_63">Cr.P.C</a>.,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_64"> of
the Code</a> must be strictly followed, since they are conceived in
public interest and as a guarantee against frivolous and
vexacious investigation.
</p><p id="p_39">      A Full bench of Allahabad High Court in Shyam Lal
Sharma Vs King Emperor , held as under : 
</p><p id="p_40">       <a href="/doc/949418/" id="a_65">Section 155</a> Cr.P.C., occurs in Chapter XIV of the Code,
which deals with investigation of the offence. It makes a
marked distinction between cognizable and non-cognizable 
offences.  It authorizes police officer incharge of a police
station to investigate the cognizable offence without the order
of a Magistrate, but forbids the police officer from
investigating a non-cognizable case unless, ordered by a
Magistrate to do so.  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_66">Section 155</a> (2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_67">Cr.P.C</a>., shall deal with
this matter and reads thus :
</p><p id="p_41">       No police officer shall investigate a non-cognizable case
without the order of a Magistrate of the first or second class,
having power to try such case or commit the same for trial, or
of a presidency Magistrate.
</p><p id="p_42">       It is evident that it was intended by this piece of
legislation that a non-cognizable offence could not be
investigated by the police unless, the Criminal Court
possessed of necessary jurisdiction, is moved by a
complainant to take cognizance of the offence or unless a
Magistrate of the description mentioned in the Section,
considers it desirable that the offence should be investigated,
the Section occurs in a statute dealing with administration of
criminal justice which is administered in public interest and
not in the interest of any private individual.  It could not have
been intended, therefore, that a Magistrate should order the
investigation arbitrarily or capriciously.  On the other hand,
it may be legitimately assumed that it was intended that
before making the order of investigation, he would carefully
consider all the relevant circumstances, that make it
desirable that a non-cognizable offence should be investigated
in public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_43">      From the above, it is clear that the Magistrate while
either referring the case to the police under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_68">Section 156</a> (3)
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_69">Cr.P.C</a>., or while ordering investigation into a non-cognizable
offence under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_70">Section 155</a> (2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_71">Cr.P.C</a>.,, has to show
application of mind to the facts of the case.  It may not be
necessary for the Magistrate to pass a reasoned order.  The
order under reference or order directing registration of a non-
cognizable offence should contain some information showing
application of mind to the case on hand.
</p><p id="p_44">      At this stage, learned counsel for the respondents
strenuously contends that no prejudice would be caused to
the accused even if the police investigate into a non-
cognizable offence, and file charge sheet without an order
from the competent Magistrate. In support of the same, he
relies upon a Judgment of the Apex Court reported in Keshav
Lal Thakur Vs State of Bihar . It was a case where the
police registered a case under <a href="/doc/92048108/" id="a_72">Section 31</a> of the
Representation of the People Act and after completing
investigation filed a final report.  An application for discharge
was filed on the ground that the offence is a non-cognizable
one.  Since the Court took cognizance of matter, an
application under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_73">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C., was filed before Patna
High Court contending that taking cognizance was beyond the 
period of investigation.  However, the Apex Court considered
the competency of police to investigate and file final report in
a non-cognizable offence.  While holding that offence under
<a href="/doc/92048108/" id="a_74">Section 31</a> of the Representation of the People Act, as non-
cognizable, held that neither the police could investigate into
the offence nor submit a report.  However held that in view of
<a href="/doc/215736/" id="a_75">Section 2</a> (d)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_76">Cr.P.C</a>., which defines  complaint, the police can
file final report relating to af non-cognizable offence, but the
same has to be treated as a complaint of a police officer
concerned.  But that explanation will not be available to the
prosecution where the police initiates investigation into a
cognizable offence and files charge sheet for non-cognizable
offence.
</p><p id="p_45">      The situation on hand is totally different. The case is
still at the inception and no final report has been filed.
Therefore, the principles in the  above case will not apply to
the case on hand.
</p><p id="p_46">      The argument of the learned counsel for the
respondents that the order dated 09.10.2013 show
application of mind, and that the same warrants no
interference from the Court cannot be accepted. It would be
relevant to extract the order dated 09.10.2013 which reads as
under :
</p><p id="p_47">You are hereby accorded permission to conduct 
investigation under Section 504, 506 (II), 120 (B) <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_77">IPC</a>
on the report given by Musunuri Srinivasa Rao,
R/o.Flat No.505, 3-6-69, Venkataramana Towers, 
Basheerbagh, Hyderabad and filed report.
</p><p id="p_48">      The said order only refers to according permission to
conduct investigation on the basis of the report given by one
Srinivas Rao.  It does not reflect anything more than lodging
of a report.  Therefore, it cannot be said that the impugned
order was passed by the Magistrate after applying his mind to
the facts of the case.  It appears to be a case where the
learned Magistrate in a routine manner accorded permission
for registration of a crime and investigation of the case.
</p><p id="p_49">      For the aforesaid reasons, this Court is of the view that
the order under challenge has been passed without assigning
any reasons and the same deserves to be set aside. 
</p><p id="p_50">      Accordingly, the order dated 09.10.2013 passed by the
IX Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad,  is
set aside and the matter is remanded back to the concerned
Magistrate directing him to pass an order showing application
of mind to the facts in issue while referring the case to police
for investigation into a non-cognizable offence.
</p><p id="p_51">         Consequently, the Criminal Miscellaneous Petitions,
pending, if any, in this Criminal Petition shall stand closed.
