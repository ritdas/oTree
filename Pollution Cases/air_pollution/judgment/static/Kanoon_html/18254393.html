              Shri Dinesh Upadhyaya for the petitioner.

              Petitioner claiming to be a public spirited person has filed
this writ petition and has brought to the notice of this Court pollution
being caused into River Narmada in the District of Dindori, by
permitting flow of 11 'Nalas' (drains) situated in the District to merge
with the River in question.
</p><p id="p_2">2-            Interalia contending that 11 'Nalas' situated in the District
of Dindori are discharging their water and effluents into River Narmada
and, therefore, causing pollution, this writ petition has been filed and the
relief claimed is to direct the respondents to take appropriate action for
preventing merging of contaminated or polluted water of the 11 'Nalas'
into River Narmada; and, to implement the Sanitation Plan of the Urban

</p><p id="p_3">Kishore Dua Vs. State of MP and others

Administration Department, for preventing pollution of the River in
question.
</p><p id="p_4">3-             Shri Swapnil Ganguly, learned Government Advocate,
invites our attention to various provisions of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_1">National Green Tribunal
Act</a>, 2010 (hereinafter referred to as 'Act of 2010'); meaning of the word
'Environment' as defined in <a href="/doc/187339837/" id="a_2">section 2(c)</a>; 'hazardous substance' as
defined in <a href="/doc/163756197/" id="a_3">section 2(f)</a>; and, various provisions of the Act of 2010; the
jurisdiction and powers available to a Tribunal to settle disputes as are
contemplated under <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_4">section 14</a>; the relief and compensation that can be
granted by the Tribunal under <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_5">section 15</a>; provision for appeal under
<a href="/doc/175098716/" id="a_6">section 18</a>; and, argues that as the issue in question being canvassed in
this writ petition pertains to environment, including enforcement of a
legal right relating to environment; and, implementation of certain
statutory provisions as are contemplated in Schedule I, of the Act of
2010, the writ petition is 'not maintainable'.
4-             Learned Government Advocate invites our attention to
Schedule I, of the Act of 2010, and argues that in the matter of
prevention and control of pollution of water, air and environment as all
the statutory provisions applicable are contemplated in Schedule I, this
Court has no jurisdiction in the matter.
</p><p id="p_5">5-             We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and
we find much force in the preliminary objection raised by Shri Swapnil
Ganguly.
</p><p id="p_6">6-             <a href="/doc/187339837/" id="a_7">Section 2(c)</a>, of the Act of 2010, defines 'environment' to
include water, air and land and the inter-relationship that exists amongst
them and between them; so also, the inter-relationship between human
beings and other living creatures, plants, micro-organism and property.
That apart, the question involved in the matter pertains to environment
and pollution, if any, being created by the waste effluents being released
into River Narmada, is covered by the statutory provisions like Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974; and, <a href="/doc/159242890/" id="a_9">section 14</a> clearly
provides jurisdiction to a Tribunal constituted under <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_10">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_11">4</a>, of
the Act of 2010, to deal with civil cases, wherein specific question

Writ Petition No:: 3842/2015 (PIL).
</p><p id="p_7">Kishore Dua Vs. State of MP and others

relation to environment and enforcement of legal rights relating to
environment are involved.
</p><p id="p_8">7-             That being so, it is a dispute where the jurisdiction to deal
with the matter rests exclusively with the National Green Tribunal,
constituted under the Act of 2010; and, it is not appropriate for this
Court to usurp jurisdiction and deal with the matter.
8-             Accordingly, granting liberty to the petitioner to take
recourse to the remedy of approaching the Tribunal by raising an
appropriate dispute as contemplated under <a href="/doc/159242890/" id="a_12">section 14</a>, of the Act of
2010, we dispose of this writ petition.
</p><p id="p_9">9-             With the aforesaid liberty to the petitioner, the writ
petition stands disposed of.
