      RAJENDRA BABU, J.	 :
</p>

<p id="p_2">      Civil Appeal No.	670 OF 1997


      The  appellant  is  a company incorporated  under	 the
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies  Act</a>, 1956 with the object of manufacture and sale
of   cigarettes.    Members  of	  general  public  are	 the
shareholders  and  the shares of the company are  traded  in
through	 various stock exchanges in the country.  A petition
was  filed  under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article  226</a>	  of  the  Constitution	  by
respondent  No.1 seeking for a writ of mandamus to treat the
members	 of the respondent- union who are employees  working
in  the	 canteen of the appellants factory as employees	 of
the   appellant	 and  for  grant   of  monetary	 and   other
consequential  benefits.   The	canteen is provided  in	 the
factory	 premises of the appellant pursuant to <a href="/doc/759329/" id="a_3">Section 46</a> of
the  Factories	Act, 1948 [hereinafter referred to  as	the
Act],  which  obliges  a factory employing  more  than	250
workmen	 to  provide  such  a canteen.	 On  behalf  of	 the
respondents,  it  is contended that the appellant  had	been
managing  the  canteen	up to the year 1982  and  thereafter
introduced  the contract system for maintaining the  canteen
so  established;  that though the management of the  canteen
had been entrusted to the contractors from time to time, the
personnel  employed in the canteen were retained by all	 the
contractors  and  they	have   been  paid  salaries  through
contractors;   that the workmen employed in the canteen have
been provided with ESI benefits under the Code No.  VST, the
appellant,   and  benefits  arising   under  the   <a href="/doc/397345/" id="a_4">Employees
Provident  Funds Act</a> are also provided similarly;  that	 the
appellant has also provided a building along with furniture,
utensils,  cutlery, gas, electricity, water supply and other
facilities;   that the contractor is engaged only to prepare
the  food and serve it to the employees and that the quality
of  the food and the rates are controlled by the  management
of the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      On behalf of the appellant, contention was raised that
no  writ  would	 lie against the appellant inasmuch  as	 the
appellant  is  a  company, which is not an  authority  or  a
person against whom a writ would lie.  It was submitted that
they  do  not discharge any public duty and hence  the	writ
cannot	be  issued.   On  the  merits  of  the	matter,	 the
appellant  disputed various questions of fact and urged that
the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1070998/" id="a_5">Parimal Chandra Raha vs.	Life
Insurance  Corporation	of India</a>, 1995 Supp.  (2)  SCC	611,
would  not  be applicable to the appellant in the facts	 and
circumstances  of  the case.  The learned Single Judge,	 who
decided	 the matter in the first instance, held that a	writ
would  lie  against  a company under  a	 private  management
following  the decision in <a href="/doc/195326/" id="a_6">T.  Gattaiah vs.  Commissioner of
Labour</a>,	 1981  [II  ]  LLJ 54, in which	 it  was  held	that
establishment  of  a  canteen  and   its  maintenance  is  a
statutory requirement;	under <a href="/doc/663625/" id="a_7">Section 46</a> of the Act a public
duty is imposed on the company to establish and maintain the
canteen;   inasmuch  as members of the respondent-union	 are
working in the canteen they are entitled to seek a mandamus.
He,  therefore, held that when a public duty is called	upon
to be discharged by a private management, a writ of mandamus
would  lie  and	 could be issued under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article	226</a>  of	 the
Constitution.  He thus rejected the contention.
</p>

<p id="p_4">      On  the merits of the matter, the learned Single Judge
followed the decision in Parimal Chandra Rahas case holding
that  when  the duty had been enjoined on the  appellant  to
provide	 and maintain a canteen facility under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_9">Factories
Act</a>  it becomes the obligation of the appellant to establish
a  canteen  and	 that  is   what  the  appellant  had  done.
Therefore,  when that work is got done through somebody else
by   providing	the  necessary	 infrastructure	 and   other
facilities,  when  the personnel did not change	 though	 the
contractors  changed  from time to time, he held  that	they
become	employees  of  the  appellant.	On  that  basis	 the
learned	 Single	 Judge	granted reliefs sought	for  by	 the
respondents,  however,	imposing certain  restrictions	with
regard	to the age, being medically fit, on the date of	 the
writ  petition,	 had  put  in a minimum of  three  years  of
continuous  service and such service prior to the attainment
of  the	 minimum qualifying age under the company should  be
ignored.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      On  appeal,  the	Division  Bench of  the	 High  Court
affirmed  the  view taken by the learned Single Judge.	 The
Division  Bench	 referred to their decision in <a href="/doc/1933144/" id="a_10">Rakesh  Gupta
vs.   Hyderabad	 Stock Exchange Ltd.  Hyderabad &amp; Ors</a>.,	 AIR
1996  AP  430,	that  a	 writ in  the  nature  of  mandamus,
certiorari  and	 prohibition  are recognised as	 public	 law
remedies  and  are  not	 available to  enforce	private	 law
rights.	  However, noticing that the expression any  person
or authority used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_11">Article 226</a> of the Constitution should
not   be   confined  only  to  statutory   authorities	 and
instrumentalities  of State but would cover any other person
or  body  performing  public  duty.  The form  of  the	body
concerned  is  not very much relevant.	What is relevant  is
the  nature of the duty imposed on that body.  The duty must
be  judged  in the light of positive obligation owed by	 the
person or authority to the affected party, no matter by what
means  the  duty  is imposed.  On that basis,  the  Division
Bench  of  the High Court dismissed the writ appeal.   Hence
this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      On behalf of the appellant contention put forth at the
forefront is that a writ would not lie against the appellant
inasmuch  as the appellant is engaged in the manufacture and
sale of cigarettes and as an incident thereto has provided a
canteen	 to  its  workmen pursuant to  an  obligation  under
<a href="/doc/759329/" id="a_12">Section 46</a> of the Act.	Shri S.	 Ganesh, learned counsel for
the  appellant,	 pressed into service the decision  of	this
Court  in  <a href="/doc/1728255/" id="a_13">Anadi Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee  Vandas  Swami
Survarna   Jayanti  Mahotsav  Smarak   Trust  &amp;	 Ors.	 vs.
V.R.Rudani  &amp;  Ors</a>., 1989 (2) SCC 691, to contend that	mere
running	 of a factory to manufacture and sell of  cigarettes
can  never  be considered to be a public duty much  less  an
incident thereto such as providing a canteen to its workmen.
On  behalf  of the respondent, heavy reliance was placed  on
this  decision and also the decision of the High Court in T.
Gattaiahs  case, to contend that in running a canteen under
<a href="/doc/759329/" id="a_14">Section	 46</a>  of	 the Act, the appellant	 was  discharging  a
public	duty  and, therefore, a writ of mandamus  would	 lie
against it.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      In  Anadi Muktas case, the contention, similar to the
present	 case,	had  been  raised.   Writ  petitioners	were
seeking	 for  a	 writ of mandamus to put them  back  in	 the
college	 and  they were claiming only a terminal benefit  or
arrears	 of salary payable to them.  In that background,  it
was  observed  that  if the rights are purely of  a  private
character  no  mandamus	 could be issued and  also,  if	 the
management of the college were purely a private body with no
public	duty  mandamus	would not lie.	In  that  case,	 the
respondent  was	 managing  the affiliated college  to  which
public	money is paid as Government aid which played a major
role  in the control, maintenance and working of educational
institutions.	The aided institutions, it was noticed, like
Government  institutions discharge public function by way of
imparting  education to students.  They were subject to	 the
rules  and  regulations	 of the affiliating  University	 and
their  activities were closely supervised by the  University
authorities.  Employment in such institutions, therefore, is
not  devoid of any public character inasmuch as the  service
conditions  of	the  academic staff were controlled  by	 the
University  particularly  in regard to their pay scales	 and
the  protection	 by  University decisions creating  a  legal
right  or  duty	 relationship  between	the  staff  and	 the
management.   When  there is existence of such	relationship
mandamus  could	 not be refused to such an aggrieved  party.
It  was	 further  explained in that decision that  the	term
authority  used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Article 226</a> of the Constitution  should
receive	 a  liberal meaning unlike the term in	<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_16">Article	 12</a>,
which  is only for the purpose of enforcement of fundamental
rights	under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_17">Article	32.</a>   The   words  any	person	 or
authority  used	 in  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article  226</a> are,	therefore,  not	 be
confined  only to statutory authorities or instrumentalities
of  the	 State	but  would cover any other  person  or	body
performing  public duty.  The form of the body concerned  is
not  very much relevant.  What is relevant is the nature  of
the  duty imposed on that body.	 The duty must be judged  in
the  light  of	positive obligation owed by  the  person  or
authority to the affected party, no matter by what means the
duty  is imposed, if a positive obligation exists,  mandamus
cannot be denied.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      In  De  Smith, Woolf and Jowells Judicial	 Review	 of
Administrative	Action, 5th Edn., it is noticed that not all
the  activities of the private bodies are subject to private
law,  e.g., the activities by private bodies may be governed
by  the	 standards  of	public law when	 its  decisions	 are
subject to duties conferred by statute or when, by virtue of
the  function  it  is performing or  possibly  its  dominant
position  in the market, it is under an implied duty to	 act
in  the	 public	 interest.  By way of  illustration,  it  is
noticed	 that  a  private company selected to run  a  prison
although  motivated by commercial profit should be regarded,
at  least in relation to some of its activities, as  subject
to  public  law because of the nature of the function it  is
performing.   This  is	because	 the  prisoners,  for  whose
custody	 and  care it is responsible, are in the  prison  in
consequence  of	 an order of the court, and the purpose	 and
nature	of their detention is a matter of public concern and
interest.   After  detailed discussion, the learned  authors
have   summarized   the	  position    with   the   following
propositions:
</p>
<p id="p_9">      (1)  The test of whether a body is performing a public
function,  and is hence amenable to judicial review, may not
depend	upon the source of its power or whether the body  is
ostensibly   a	public	or  a  private	body.	(2)  The
principles  of	judicial  review   prima  facie	 govern	 the
activities  of	bodies	performing  public  functions.	 (3)
However,  not all decisions taken by bodies in the course of
their  public  functions are the subject matter of  judicial
review.	  In  the following two situations  judicial  review
will not normally be appropriate even though the body may be
performing a public function:
</p>
<p id="p_10">      (a)   Where  some	 other	branch	 of  the  law	more
appropriately  governs the dispute between the parties.	  In
such  a case, that branch of the law and its remedies should
and  normally  will  be applied;  and (b) Where there  is  a
contract  between the litigants.  In such a case the express
or implied terms of the agreement should normally govern the
matter.	  This reflects the normal approach of English	law,
namely,	 that  the terms of a contract will normally  govern
the  transaction, or other relationship between the parties,
rather	than the general law.  Thus, where a special  method
of  resolving disputes (such as arbitration or resolution by
private	 or  domestic  Tribunals)  has been  agreed  by	 the
parties	 (expressly  or	 by   necessary	 implication),	that
regime,	 and  not judicial review, will normally govern	 the
dispute.
</p>

<p id="p_11">      The  High	 Court	has  relied  very  strongly  on	 the
decision  of  a learned Single Judge in T.  Gattaiahs  case
wherein	 it was stated that a writ may lie under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_19">Article 226</a>
of the Constitution against a company incorporated under the
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_20">Companies  Act</a>,	 1956 as it is permissible to issue  a	writ
against	 any  person.	Prima facie,  therefore,  a  private
person or an incorporated company cannot be taken out of the
sweep	and  the  contemplation	 of   <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_21">Article  226</a>  of	 the
Constitution.	That decision does not take note of the fact
as  to	the  nature  of the functions that a  person  or  an
incorporated  company  should  be   performing	to   attract
judicial  review under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_22">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.	  In
Anadi  Muktas case this Court examined the various  aspects
and  the  distinction between an authority and a person	 and
after analysis of the decisions referred in that regard came
to  the conclusion that it is only in the circumstances when
the  authority	or the person performs a public function  or
discharges a public duty <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_23">Article 226</a> of the Constitution can
be  invoked.  In the present case, the appellant is  engaged
in  the manufacture and sale of cigarettes.  Manufacture and
sale  of  cigarettes will not involve any  public  function.
Incidental  to	that activity there is an  obligation  under
<a href="/doc/663625/" id="a_24">Section	 46</a>  of	 the  Act  to set  up  a  canteen  when	 the
establishment  has more than 250 workmen.  That means, it is
a  condition  of service in relation to a workman  providing
better	facilities  to	workmen to  discharge  their  duties
properly and maintain their own health or welfare.  In other
words, it is only a labour welfare device for the benefit of
its  work  force unlike a provision where <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_25">Pollution  Control
Act</a>  makes  it obligatory even on a private company  not  to
discharge  certain effluents.  In such cases public duty  is
owed to the public in general and not specific to any person
or  group  of  persons.	 Further the damage  that  would  be
caused in not observing them is immense.  If merely what can
be  considered	a  part of the conditions of  service  of  a
workman	 is  violated  then  we do not think  there  is	 any
justification  to  hold	 that such activity will  amount  to
public	duty.  Thus, we are of the view that the High  Court
fell  into  error  that	 appellant   is	 amenable  to	writ

<p id="p_12">      This  Court in <a href="/doc/1411892/" id="a_26">Indian Petrochemicals Corporation	Ltd.
&amp;  Anr.	 vs.  Shramik Sena &amp; Ors</a>., 1999(6) SCC 439, referred
to  the	 decisions in Parimal Chandra Rahas  case,  <a href="/doc/1335358/" id="a_27">Reserve
Bank of India vs.  Workmen</a>, 1996 (3) SCC 267, and <a href="/doc/705724/" id="a_28">M.M.R.Khan
vs.   Union of India</a>, 1990 Supp.  SCC 191, and held that the
workmen	 of  a	statutory canteen, as in the  present  case,
would be workmen of an establishment for the purposes of the
Act only and not for other purposes.  Thereafter, this Court
further	 examined whether the material on record would	show
that  the  workmen are employees of the management  for	 all
purposes and adopted some of the tests as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_13">      1.   The canteen has been there since the inception of
the appellants factory.	 2.  The workmen have been employed
for  long  years  and despite a change	of  contractors	 the
workers	 have  continued to be employed in the canteen.	  3.
The   premises,	 furniture,   fixture,	fuel,	electricity,
utensils, etc.	have been provided for by the appellant.  4.
The  wages  of the canteen workers have to be reimbursed  by
the  appellant.	  5.   The supervision and  control  on	 the
canteen is exercised by the appellant through its authorised
officer,  as  can  be seen from the various clauses  of	 the
contract  between the appellant and the contractor.  6.	 The
contractor  is	nothing	 but an agent or a  manager  of	 the
appellant,  who	 works	completely  under  the	supervision,
control	 and  directions of the appellant.  7.	The  workmen
have   the  protection	of   continuous	 employment  in	 the
establishment.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      In  the  present	case, the findings recorded  by	 the
learned	 Single Judge on examination of the facts  available
is  that there had been a canteen within the premises of the
appellant  up  to  the year 1982 and it is  only  from	1982
onwards	 the management of the canteen has been entrusted to
a  private  contractor;	  that	even  after  change  of	 the
contractor,  the  canteen workers have continued to  be	 the
same irrespective of the change in the contractors from time
to time;  that wages were paid to the workmen in the canteen
by   the  management  through	the  contractor;   that	 the
appellant  has provided the accommodation, furniture,  fuel,
electricity,  utensils, etc.;  that the management exercises
control	 over the standard in quality, quantity and the rate
of  the food items supplied to the workmen for whose benefit
the  canteen  is  established.	 Thus,	these  circumstances
clearly	 indicate that the appellant has a complete  control
over  the  activities  in  respect of the  canteen  and	 the
contractor  has absolutely no discretion either in regard to
the  menu, quality and quantity of the food items much	less
the  rate  at  which the same are supplied to  the  workmen.
When  the  management  of  the appellant  exercises  such  a
complete  control, the canteen shall be deemed to be run  by
the  management itself.	 The appellant in any manner  cannot
controvert these facts.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      We do agree that the respondents have a strong case on
merits.	  Since	 we  have held that the High  Court  had  no
jurisdiction  to  entertain a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_29">Article 226</a>  of
the  Constitution, we would have set aside the order made by
the  High  Court.  However, in the special features  of	 the
case,  although	 we do not agree with the High Court on	 the
first  question raised, we feel, after clarifying the  legal
position,  that we should not disturb the decision given  by
the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      The  appeal,  therefore, stands dismissed	 subject  to
what  is stated in regard to writs to be issued by the	High
Court in respect of persons or authorities exercising public
duty or otherwise.  No costs.
</p>


<p id="p_17">      Civil Appeal Nos.	 6533/97 &amp; 6534/97

      In  these appeals, on a reference made on the question
whether	 certain  persons employed in the canteen should  be
treated	 as  employees of the appellant and, if so, in	what
category they are to be fitted in and to what wages they are
entitled   to,	 the	 Industrial   Tribunal,	  Hyderabad,
[hereinafter  referred	to as the Tribunal] inquired  into
the  matter.  The contesting respondents contended that	 the
workmen	 in  the  canteen had been working  right  from	 its
inception,  that  is, since 1967;  that from  1976  onwards,
after  expiry  of the contract with the Industrial  Catering
Services,  they had been directly working with the appellant
without any contractor;	 that they sought for regularization
of  their services by letter dated 28.2.1978;  that the said
letter	was corrected and redrafted by the Personnel Manager
to  indicate the idea of floating an Association/Society  to
run  the  canteen;  that this modified request contained  in
Ex.W-49 was stated to be contradictory to the stand taken by
the  workmen all through.  The Tribunal concluded that there
was no doubt that the Personnel Manager modified Ex.W-50 and
obtained  Ex.W-49  in the modified form.  The Tribunal	held
against	 them,	as  there was no material to show  that	 the
management  had	 discussed on each point and  thereafter  an
agreement  had	been  drafted.	The  Tribunal  recorded	 the
findings  that the canteen had been working for the  benefit
of  the workmen within the premises provided by and with the
equipment  supplied  by the appellant;	that  the  appellant
supplies  the provisions for the preparation of	 foodstuffs;
that  the  appellant issues token to the employees,  who  on
production  of the same obtain foodstuffs from the  canteen;
that  the  Committee appointed by the appellant decides	 the
menu  and  as  per  the directions and	supervision  of	 the
Catering  Officer, the canteen functions;  that the  quality
and  quantity  of the foodstuffs is supervised by  him,	 who
functions  under the Committee.	 The contributions like ESI,
Provident  Fund, etc.  had also been categorically specified
to  be	provided  by  the appellant and	 ESI  code  for	 the
permanent  establishment and for the present workmen was the
same;	that after the evidence was tendered by the  workmen
the  appellant	got  the  code	changed	 and  the  appellant
transferred  the workmen from one place to another and	that
the  amount to be surrendered by way of unpaid salaries	 had
to  be	remitted back to the management.  Thus the  Tribunal
held  that these facts clearly indicated that the  appellant
exercised administrative, financial and disciplinary control
over  the  workmen in question.	 The Tribunal held  that  no
other  material is required to hold them to be employees  of
the  appellant.	 In those circumstances, the Tribunal passed
an  award that these workmen should be treated as  employees
of  the	 appellant  and	 they are  entitled  to	 payment  of
appropriate  scales and designations in terms of Ex.W12	 and
W14  from  1.4.1979  with all  consequential  and  attendant
benefits  of arrears of pay, etc.  together with counting of
entire	service	 for  the   purpose  of	 terminal  benefits.
Against	 this  award, a writ petition was filed	 before	 the
High  Court.  The High Court dismissed the same stating that
it  is	covered	 by another matter.  It	 is  unnecessary  to
examine	 the  contention whether the matter is covered by  a
subsequent  decision or not as the facts of the present case
stand  on  its	own.   The reference had been  made  to	 the
Tribunal  and adjudication had been made by the Tribunal  as
to  the	 status	 of the workmen, the nature  of	 employment,
control	 exercised by the appellant, which leave no room for
doubt that they are the employees of the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      A	 contention is also sought to be made that it is not
possible  to  run  a canteen in the refinery  area.   It  is
contended  that	 under the Petroleum Rules framed under	 the
<a href="/doc/1083713/" id="a_30">Petroleum Act</a>, 1934, there are certain hazardous areas where
there  cannot  be a canteen as no fire, furnace,  source  of
heat  or light capable of igniting inflammable vapours shall
be  allowed  except  in	 the firing  spaces  or	 stills	 and
boilers.   However,  there is no material on record to	show
that  the canteen is located in such an area where it  would
be  hazardous  to  have a fire, furnace, source of  heat  or
light  to  cook food.  In the absence of such  material,  we
find  no substance in this contention.	It is brought to our
notice	that  a fire had taken place on a tank on  14.9.1997
and  that it was extinguished after 14 days, which  severely
damaged all the building including the canteen and that food
and  beverages being provided to its employees by making  an
arrangement  to obtain the same from outside the premises of
the  appellant.	 These facts are brought to our notice by an
affidavit  filed  on 21.11.2000.  But these factors  do	 not
come  in the way of the award made by the Tribunal, as it is
possible to locate the canteen in an appropriate place where
there is no hazard of the kind envisaged under the Petroleum
Rules.	This contention is also rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      In   the	circumstances	aforesaid,  the	  contention
vis-à-vis  the	findings recorded by the Tribunal,  we	find
absolutely  no	merit  in these appeals and the	 same  shall
stand dismissed.  No costs.
