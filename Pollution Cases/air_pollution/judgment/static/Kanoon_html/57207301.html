                Dated this the 28th day of June, 2016

                               JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">           Without going into the details on the facts, the petitioner

was aggrieved with a mill carried on by the 5th respondent in the

adjacent property. Both the petitioner and the 5th respondent had

been before this Court time and again, raising rival contentions to

continue the operation of the mill and to stop the same. The 5th

respondent was found to have no consent from the Kerala State

Pollution Control Board [for brevity "the Board"] and, hence, was

directed to seek a consent from the Board, which was refused by

the Board. An appeal was filed against the same, which is said to

be taken as File No.2703/05 before the Appellate Authority. The writ

petition was filed specifically contending that the appeal is not being

taken up for consideration and in such circumstance, the

Panchayat is unable to close down the mill. The prayer is also to

place Appeal No.3/2005 filed by the 5th respondent before the

Appellate Authority constituted under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_1">Section 31</a> of the Air

(Prevention &amp; Control of Pullution) Act, 1981 expeditiously.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WP(C) No.6907 of 2006               - 2 -</span>




</p><p id="p_2">            2. It is not clear as to whether the aforesaid appeal is still

pending before the Appellate Authority and if it is so pending,

definitely the petitioner could move the Appellate Authority for an

expeditious disposal; in which event, the contentions of either

parties are left open to be agitated before the said authority. If the

appeal is already disposed of, the remedy of each party to challenge

the said order is also left open. As of now, the writ petition has

become infructuous and the same is dismissed. No costs.
