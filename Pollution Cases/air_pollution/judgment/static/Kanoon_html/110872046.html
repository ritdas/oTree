<p id="p_4">JUDGMENT BY THE BENCH


              This Appeal is filed assailing the legality of the order dated
September 12th, 2011, passed by Special Secretary, Environment
Department, UP Government, in exercise of the powers conferred upon
him under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_1">Section 31</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>
1981.
</p>

<p id="p_5">2.            With a view to avoid unnecessary detail, the short facts leading
to the present Appeal are as follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              (i)        The Appellant is the owner of a piece of land, Gata No.
                         870, situated at Village Lakhaiya Pargana Charda, Tehsil
                         Nanpara, District Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              (ii)       The Appellant intended to establish a Brick Kiln over the
                         said land and filed an Application before the competent
                         authority for granting license / no objection certificate,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                   2</span>
         under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
        1981. The authorities after due process granted no
        objection     certificate   on   October   1st,   2009   for
        establishment of Brick Kiln.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_6">(iii)   After obtaining the no objection certificate, the Appellant,
        it is averred, took steps for setting up the Brick Kiln.
        Thereafter, it is alleged, some frivolous allegations were
        made by the adversaries and rivals of the Appellant
        before the Authorities. After receiving the complaint, the
        Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Nanpara, by order dated
        October 10th, 2009, called upon the Appellant to show
        cause and produce the relevant documents relating to
        the establishment of the Brick Kiln. The said direction
        was duly complied with by the Appellant, within the time
        prescribed.
</p>

<p id="p_7">(iv)    That the Sub-Divisional Magistrate conducted a field
        enquiry, recorded the statements of the complainant and
        other villagers and being satisfied submitted a report in
        favour of the Appellant, to the District Magistrate.
        Thereafter, the Appellant established his Kiln and
        obtained registration certificate.
</p>

<p id="p_8">(v)     While the matter stood thus, it is alleged, he received the
        order dated October 21st, 2009 from the Regional Officer
        of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (U.P PCB),
        Faizabad, revoking the no objection certificate granted to
        the Appellant. The Appellant being aggrieved, assailed
        the said order before the High Court of Allahabad in Writ
        Petition No. 11816/2009. The said writ petition was
        disposed of granting liberty to the petitioner to move an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                           3</span>
        application against the impugned order before the
       appropriate authority. In consonance with the direction,
       the Appellant, it is submitted, filed an application before
       U.P PCB on December 23rd, 2009. After receipt of the
       application from the Appellant, it appears, the Regional
       Officer, U.P PCB, conducted the site inspection, which
       revealed that the Brick Kiln in question was installed at a
       place other than the place for which no objection was
       granted. It also did not satisfy the guidelines set forth by
       the District Board. That apart, the Brick Kiln was set-up at
       a distance of 80 meters from Abadi lands with thick
       population.       After     considering   the      facts    and
       circumstances, by a well discussed order dated January
       19th, 2010, the U.P PCB rejected the petition filed by the
       Appellant and confirmed the order cancelling the no
       objection certificate.
</p>

<p id="p_9">(vi)   The Appellant once again approached the Hon'ble High
       Court challenging the order passed by the Board but the
       Hon'ble    High     Court    of   Allahabad     dismissed   the
       application, permitting the Appellant to prefer an Appeal
       in accordance with law. Thereafter, the Appellant filed an
       appeal under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_4">Section 31(2)</a> of the Air Act, 1981, which
       was registered as AIR Appeal No. 2/2010. The Appellate
       Authorities, as would be evident from the judgment,
       dated September 12th, 2011 (Annexure A-1), discussed
       the facts and circumstances, and came to the conclusion
       that the findings arrived at by the Board do not suffer
       from any infirmity and dismissed the Appeal.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                          4</span>
<p id="p_10"> 3.       The said order is impugned before this Tribunal. In the course of
hearing, Mr. Javed Ahmad, Learned Counsel for the Appellant,
submitted that if another opportunity is granted to the Appellant to make
a fresh application for granting no objection certificate in respect of his
personal lands, he would withdraw this Appeal.
</p>

<p id="p_11">4.       Learned Counsel for the Respondents, however, submitted that
the Appellant having misused the no objection certificate granted in his
favour not only by changing the site, but also by flouting the siting criteria
as evident from the findings of the authorities, under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a>, the
present Appeal should be dismissed. It is further submitted that the
Appellant not having come to the Court with clean hands, is not entitled
to any relief.
</p>

<p id="p_12">5.       We heard Learned Counsel for the parties at length. In view of
the submissions made by Mr. Javed Ahmad, Learned Counsel
appearing for the Appellant, that he does not want to press this Appeal
and wants to withdraw the same, we find no reason to go into the merits
of the case. Accordingly, we permit the Appellant to withdraw the
Appeal, but then we grant liberty to the Appellant to file a fresh
application before the competent authority in respect of the lands, that
satisfy the siting criteria for a Brick Kiln. If such an application is filed
enclosing all relevant documents, the competent Authority shall do well
to conduct a site inspection, complete the formalities and dispose of the
said application strictly in accordance with law. The said exercise should
be completed as expeditiously as possible. This Appeal is accordingly
disposed of as withdrawn.
