<p id="p_1">                 (Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE CHAKRADHARI SHARAN
                 SINGH)

8   05-02-2016            Heard Mr. Mrigank Mauli, learned counsel for the

                 petitioner, Mr. P.K.Verma, learned AAG5 and Mr. Shivendra

                 Kishore, learned Senior counsel for the respondent Pollution

                 Board.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                          By an order dated 18.1.2016 passed by this Court certain

                 specific direction had been issued to the respondents, which were

                 considered essential, so as to keep in control the menace of noise

                 pollution, within the municipal areas of the State of Bihar, being

                 caused by the Loudspeakers, Vehicles and Fire Crackers. The

                 order speaks for itself. We had, inter alia, directed the Principal

                 Secretary, Home Department, Government of Bihar, to ensure

                 publication through the Electronic Media for the purpose of notice
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court CWJC No.18942 of 2015 (8) dt.05-02-2016                              2</span>




             and general awareness among the people about various directions

             issued by the authorities, for the purpose of controlling noise

             pollution. It was specifically indicated that any breach of the order

             of this Court by any person including those who obstruct or intend

             to obstruct implementation of this order or fail to carry out the

             order shall be viewed seriously.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                       Mr. Mrigank Mauli, learned counsel appearing on behalf

             of the petitioner, submits that the State respondents have

             miserably failed to comply with the order and noise pollution is

             being caused within the municipal areas, with impunity as a result

             of laches on the part of the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                       The submission has not been disputed by the learned

             counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent State of Bihar and

             the Bihar Pollution Control Board. There is nothing on record to

             show that paragraph no.18 of the order, whereby following

             direction was issued, has been implemented:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                              "18. We direct the Principal Secretary, Home
                              Department, Government of Bihar, to ensure,
                              publication through Print and Electronic Media in
                              order to make people of Bihar aware about the
                              directions issued by the authorities for controlling
                              noise pollution throughout the State of Bihar from
                              time to time and a composite guidelines be issued,
                              in this regard, to be followed throughout the State."</blockquote><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">                       Mr. Shivendra Kishore, Learned Senior counsel appearing

             on behalf of the Bihar Pollution Control Board, has informed us

             that so far no prosecution has been initiated against any person

             causing noise pollution in violation of the provisions of the Air

             (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>. 1981. It may be noted

             here that failure to initiate prosecution for violation of the

             provisions of the Act and the directions issued by this Court may

             also lead to prosecution of the persons responsible, in accordance

             with law.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                       Mr. Shivendra Kihsore has further submitted that there are

             certain practical aspects and reasons because of which the officials

             of the Board have so far not been able to prosecute the persons,

             violating the provisions of the Act and this order. He will be at

             liberty to file an affidavit enumerating the reasons, which have so

             far disabled them from implementing the Court's order or

             initiating prosecution against the erring persons.

             appearing on behalf of the State of Bihar, while admitting the fact

             that the order of this Court has so far not been implemented,

             would submit that sincere effort is being taken by the State

             officials to ensure control of noise pollution. He has drawn our

             attention to the counter affidavit filed on behalf of respondents no.

<p id="p_10">                                 We have perused the said counter affidavit carefully. The

                      contents of the affidavit are not at all satisfactory. What we gather

                      from the affidavits on record and the submissions made on behalf

                      of the parties that this Court's order dated 18.1.2016 has been

                      followed more in breach than in compliance. We take serious note

                      of such situation. We, accordingly, direct the Principal Secretary,

                      Home Department, Government of Bihar, to file an affidavit

                      within ten days from today stating the steps taken for strict

                      compliance of this Court's order dated 18.1.2016, including the

                      action taken against the violators of law and the order of this

                      Court.
