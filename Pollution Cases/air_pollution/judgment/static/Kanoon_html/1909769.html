:COMMON ORDER


</pre><p id="p_2">Since  the  issue  raised  in both the Revision Petitions is one and the same,
they are being disposed of by  the  following  common  order.    Defendant  in
O.S.No.   516 of 1999 on the file of the Additional District Munsif, Namakkal,
aggrieved by the order dated 12-4-2002 passed in the suit,  holding  that  the
District  Munsif's  Court  has jurisdiction to try the issue raised, has filed
C.R.P.No.  797/2002 under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.  The very same petitioner, aggrieved by the order of the same  Court  dated
26-8-2002 in I.A.No.    874/99  in  O.S.No.    516/99, granting injunction and
continuing the same without taking up the injunction  application,  has  filed
C.R.P.No.  1751/2002 under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_2">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.   According  to the plaintiff/respondent herein, he filed a suit in O.S.No.
516 of 1999 on  the  file  of  the  District  Munsif,  Namakkal,  against  the
defendant/petitioner   herein   for   permanent  injunction,  restraining  him
(defendant/petitioner herein) from carrying on the business of stone  crushing
by using  the  stone  Crushers  in S.No.204 /4A of Marurpatty village.  In the
said suit, the respondent  contended  that  if  the  petitioner  operates  the
crushing unit in S.No.  204/4A, it will generate dust pollution and due to the
same  the  respondent  and  his  family members will be put to great hardship,
inconvenience and loss.  Further, the petitioner has not  obtained  any  order
from  the  Tamil  Nadu  Pollution  Control  Board; hence the petitioner is not
entitled to carry on the operation.  The respondent herein filed I.A.No.874/99
and obtained an order of injunction on 25-8-99.  The respondent has  no  right
to file a civil suit against the crushing unit which has obtained consent from
the  Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board for running the unit by complying with
the terms and conditions of the Board.  In view of the bar under the Act,  the
person  aggrieved  can  file a complaint only before the appropriate authority
constituted under the Act.  The learned District Munsif has framed  the  issue
of  maintainability of the suit as a preliminary issue as to whether the court
has jurisdiction to try the suit.   As  against  the  order  of  the  District
Munsif, in  the  preliminary  issue,  the  petitioner  has  filed C.R.P.No.  5
72/2001 before this Court.  By order dated 20-7-2001, this Court dismissed the
said Revision holding that the suit is maintainable.   The  dismissal  of  the
earlier C.R.P.   will not inhibit the petitioner from seeking the legal remedy
that is available to him.  It is also stated that though the learned  District
Munsif  granted an injunction on 25-8 -99 and even after filing his counter on
20-1-2000, the trial Judge  without  taking  the  injunction  application  for
enquiry and dispose of the same, is extending the injunction order without any
valid  reason  and thereby preventing the petitioner from running the crushing
unit.  In C.R.P.No.  797/2002 the petitioner has claimed that the Court  below
has no   jurisdiction  to  hear  the  main  suit  namely  O.S.No.516/99.    In
C.R.P.No.1751/2002 the very same petitioner has claimed that in any event  the
Court   below  was  not  justified  in  keeping  the  injunction  application,
particularly even after filing of the counter affidavit.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.  Heard Mr.    M.    Venkatachalapathy,  learned  senior  counsel  for   the
petitioner and Mr.  K.  Yamunan, learned counsel for respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.  The following questions are to be considered in these Revisions:
</p><p id="p_7">(i) Whether the suit filed by the respondent-plaintiff is barred under <a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_3">Section
46</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981?
</p><p id="p_8">(ii)  In  any  event,  whether  the  Court  below was justified in keeping the
injunction application namely I.A.No.874/99 without disposing of the same  one
way or other?
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.   The plaintiff/respondent herein has filed O.S.No.5 16 of 1999 on the file
of the District Munsif, Namakkal against the defendant/petitioner  herein  for
permanent  injunction  restraining  the defendant from carrying on business of
stone crushing by using stone crushers in S.No.  204/4A of Marurpatti village.
It is the grievance of the petitioner that inasmuch as the relief  prayed  for
flows from the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Pollution Control Act</a>, the Civil Court is not the proper Forum.
It  is  also  his  case  that the Court below has omitted to consider that the
cause of action for the suit is the running of the stone crushing unit by  the
petitioner in Survey No.  204/4A in Marurpatti village, resulting in pollution
of  air  and  on this ground the injunction is sought for which cannot be gone
into by the Civil Court.  On the other hand, it is the claim of the respondent
that the very same issue namely ousting of Civil  Court  jurisdiction  by  the
provisions  of  Air  (  Prevention  and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control  of  Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 was
considered and rejected by the lower Court  and  upheld  by  this  Court,  the
present objection  is  not  maintainable.    Apart from the said aspect, it is
stated that the trial court, by order dated 3-1-2001,  while  considering  the
very same issue, has held that suit is maintainable in the Civil Court and the
Revision filed  buy  the  petitioner before this Court in C.R.P.No.  5 72/2001
was also dismissed on 20-7-2001.  In the light of the said order of the  trial
Court  and  the  affirmation  by this Court, the petitioner is not entitled to
raise the same objection once again.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.  In the light of the various averments, I have carefully perused the plaint
averments in O.S.No.516 of 99 and the order of the trial  Court  holding  that
the suit  is  maintainable.    Learned  senior  counsel for the petitioner, by
drawing my attention to <a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_7">Section 46</a> of  the  Air  (Prevention  and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control  of
Pollution)  Act</a>,  1981  ( hereinafter referred to as "the Act"), would contend
that inasmuch as the issue relates to air pollution, the Authority  under  the
Act  alone  is competent to consider the same and by virtue of <a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_9">Section 46</a>, the
jurisdiction of the Civil Court is completely barred.  In order to  appreciate
the said contention, it is useful to refer <a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_10">Section 46</a>:
</p>
<p id="p_11">"<a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_11">Section 46</a>.   Bar of jurisdiction:- No civil court shall have jurisdiction to
entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter which  an  Appellate
Authority  constituted  under  this  Act  is empowered by or under this Act to
determine, and no injunction shall be granted by any court or other  authority
in  respect  of  any  action  taken  or  to be taken in pursuance of any power
conferred by or under this Act."
</p>
<p id="p_12">It is clear from the above provision that in respect of any  matter  which  an
Appellate  Authority in this Act is empowered, Civil Court has no jurisdiction
to entertain any suit and no injunction shall be granted  in  respect  of  any
action taken  or  to be taken by the Authority concerned.  Though prior to the
filing of the suit, the plaintiff was having  permission  from  the  Pollution
Control  Board to use Crusher, admittedly, on the date of the suit, he was not
having any order from the Board.  In such a circumstance, as rightly contended
by the learned counsel for the respondent, the plaintiff has to  approach  the
Civil  Court  to  vindicate  his grievance, if any, relating to air pollution.
<a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_12">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_13">4</a> of the Act enable to form Central Pollution Control Board and
State Pollution Control Board respectively.  The powers and functions  of  the
Boards  have  been  specifically  stated in various sections of Chapter II and
III.  As per <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_14">Section 21</a>, no person shall, without the previous consent of  the
State  Board  establish  or  operate  an  industrial plant in an air pollution
control area.  As per <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_15">Section 31</a> (1), any person aggrieved by an order made by
the State Board may, within 30 days from  the  date  on  which  the  order  is
communicated to  him, prefer an appeal to the Appellate Authority.  As rightly
pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondent, those matters which the
Appellate Authority is empowered to decide,  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Civil
Court is  taken  under  <a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_16">Section 46</a> of the Act.  I have already referred to the
fact that on the date of the suit, the defendant was not having any order from
the Pollution Control Board or from any Authority  under  the  Act.    As  per
<a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_17">Section  46</a>,  if  there  is an order by the Authority concerned, either by the
State Board or by any one, the aggrieved  person  cannot  challenge  the  same
before  the  Civil  Court  and  the  only  remedy  for  him is to approach the
Appellate Authority under the Act to  vindicate  his  grievance  and  not  all
matters are barred under  <a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_18">Section  46</a>  of  the Act.  Mr.  K.  Yamunan, learned
counsel for the respondent, has very much relied on a decision of  the  Andhra
Pradesh High Court in  <a href="/doc/53182/" id="a_19">M/s.    Sreenivasa  Distilleries v.  S.R.  Thyagarajan</a>,
reported in AIR 1986 Andhra Pradesh 328.  A learned Single Judge of the Andhra
Pradesh High Court, while considering <a href="/doc/598206/" id="a_20">Section 58</a> of the Water ( Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_21">Control of Pollution) Act</a> (Act 6/1974), which is similar to <a href="/doc/1982406/" id="a_22">Section 46</a> of  the
Air  Act,  has held that <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_23">Section 58</a> does not bar jurisdiction of a civil Court
to entertain such a suit.  <a href="/doc/598206/" id="a_24">Section 58</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_25">Control  of
Pollution)  Act</a> bars the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to entertain any suit
or proceeding against an order passed  by  the  appellate  authority.    While
construing the  said  provision, the learned Judge has held as follows:  (para
</p><p id="p_13">4)

"4?.<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_26">Section 58</a> enacts two prohibitions.  Firstly, not to entertain any suit or
proceedings in respect of any matter which the appellate authority constituted
under the Act is empowered to determine.  Secondly,  no  injunction  shall  be
granted  in  respect  of  any  action  taken by any authority under the Act in
pursuance of the provisions of the Act.  This is the  only  provision  barring
the jurisdiction  of  a Civil Court.  The section is intended to prese5rve the
statutory protection given to the Boards untouched by civil actions.  Now, the
present action is only preventing the defendant from  polluting  water.    But
this  section  is  not  directed  to  annul any orders passed by the authority
constituted under this Act.  Now, it is admitted that  no  orders  are  passed
under  the  Act,  and, therefore, any order passed by the Civil Court will not
take away the jurisdiction of the authorities constituted under the Act?.."
</p>
<p id="p_14">There is no dispute that <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_27">Section 58</a> referred  to  in  the  above  decision  is
similar  to  <a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_28">Section  46</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_29">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
concerned in the case on hand.  As rightly observed by the learned Judge,  the
section  is  intended to preserve the statutory protection given to the Boards
untouched by civil actions.  In the absence of  any  order  by  the  Board  or
intervention  by  the  Authority  under the Act, any order passed by the Civil
Court will not take away the jurisdictional aspect constituted under the  Act.
I  am  of  the  view  that  matters  which  are  not to be agitated before the
appellate authority,  the  Civil  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  entertain  and
consider the same.
</p>
<p id="p_15">8.   Apart  from  the  above  legal  position,  it is seen that working of the
Stone-Crushing unit in S.No.  204/4A will be environmental hazard and a source
of air pollution, affecting the health of the people residing in the locality.
It is highlighted by the respondent herein that when the petitioner wanted  to
re-commission  the  unit,  several  objections  were raised by various people,
including the Panchayat Union and the respondent, that one  Selvakumar,  whose
house is situate about 100 metres from the crushing unit, also objected to the
same  and that on a consideration of all these objections and after inspecting
the site, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board directed the  petitioner  not
to  recommence  the unit at the existing site and refused to renew the consent
order.  It is also brought  to  my  notice  that  the  Commissioner,  Namakkal
Panchayat Union has cancelled the licence of the petitioner and the Tamil Nadu
Electricity  Board  has  disconnected  the  service connection to the crushing
unit.  Further, in the light of the specific objection raised in  the  written
statement  regarding  maintainability  of  the  suit,  the  learned Additional
District Munsif, Namakkal framed a preliminary  issue  regarding  jurisdiction
and  after  full-fledged  enquiry, came to the conclusion that Civil Court has
jurisdiction to try the suit.  Against the said order, the  petitioner  herein
preferred C.R.P.No.   572/2001.  Here again, elaborate arguments were advanced
by both sides regarding bar of Civil Court's jurisdiction.  This Court (Prabha
Sridevan, J) by order dated 20-7-2001, after considering the matter  in  issue
in  detail  with  reference  to  the  provisions,  namely,  <a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_30">Section 2</a> (a) (b),
<a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_31">Sections 31</a> and <a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_32">46</a> of the Act and the ultimate conclusion of the trial  Court,
confirmed  the  decision  of  the  trial  Court  holding  that Civil Court has
jurisdiction, and dismissed the Revision finding no ground  for  interference.
No  doubt,  the  learned  Judge  has  observed that the dismissal of the C.R.P
(C.R.P.  No.572/2001) will not inhibit the petitioner from seeking  the  legal
remedy that  is  available to him under law.  After the order of this Court in
C.R.P.No.  572/2001 dated 20-07-2001, confirming the order of the Court  below
stating  that suit is maintainable in the Civil Court, the petitioner filed an
additional written statement on 19-2-2002 and again raised the  same  question
before the  trial Court.  Once again the trial Court by order dated 12-4-2002,
held that the suit is maintainable and the Civil Court's jurisdiction  is  not
ousted by  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_33">Central  Act</a>  14/1981.  Against the said order, the petitioner once
again challenged the same in C.R.P.No.797/2002.  In the light of  the  factual
details,namely,  the  statutory  provisions referred to above and the order of
this Court in C.R.P.No.  572/2001 dated 20-7-2001, I am in agreement with  the
order  of  the  trial  Court  dated 12-4-2002 holding that the suit as laid is
maintainable.

<p id="p_16">9.  Coming to I.A.No.  874/99 in O.S.No.516/99, which was  filed  for  interim
injunction,  it  is seen from the certified copy of the order, even on 25-8-99
the learned District Munsif after holding that prima facie case was  made  out
and balance of convenience was in favour of the petitioner, granted ad-interim
injunction till  8-9-99  and  ordered notice to the respondent.  It is further
seen that on the next hearing date i.e., on 8-9-99, vakalath  had  been  filed
for the  respondent.   It is further seen that after several adjournments, the
respondent filed counter on 20-1-2000 in the  injunction  application.    Even
after  filing  of counter by the sole respondent, the learned District Munsif,
instead of disposing the said application,  granted  several  adjournments  by
mentioning "enquiry?.Injunction  order  extended?..".    Finally,  this  Court
stayed the enquiry  on  30-4-2002  in  C.M.P.No.    63  58/2002  in  C.R.P.No.
797/2002.   It  is  not  clear,  particularly when the learned District Munsif
having found that  the  suit  is  maintainable  and  after  knowing  that  the
respondent  had filed counter affidavit in the injunction application, why the
said application has been kept pending  without  passing  orders  one  way  or
other.   This Court has repeatedly held in all Interlocutory Applications that
whenever the contesting party or parties filed counter affidavit/statement, it
is incumbent on the part of the Court to dispose of the same one way or other.
The said recourse has not been adopted by the learned District Munsif instead,
he adjourned the said application on several occasions without any cause.

<p id="p_17">10.  In the light of what is stated above, in view of the first order  of  the
trial  Court  dated  3-1-2001 holding that the Civil Court has jurisdiction to
try the issue in question, order of this Court in C.R.P.No.    572/2001  dated
20-7-2001  confirming  the  said  order,  in the light of the language used in
<a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_34">Section 46</a> of the Act, and the plaintiff  is  not  challenging  any  order  or
proceedings  of the Pollution Control Board or Authority constituted under the
Act, I hold that the suit instituted by the plaintiff is maintainable.  It  is
made  clear  that  if  the matter in issue is to be considered by an Appellate
Authority under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_35">section 31</a> of the Act, undoubtedly, the Civil Court is  barred
under <a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_36">Section  46</a> of the Act.  In the light of the earlier conclusion that the
learned District Munsif was not justified  in  keeping  I.A.No.874/99,  he  is
directed  to  dispose  of  the  same  on  merits one way or other on or before
30-04-2003, after affording sufficient opportunity to  both  parties.    After
disposal  of  the  said  application,  it is for him to dispose of the suit on
merits expeditiously, uninfluenced by any  of  the  observations  made  above.
Both the  Civil Revision Petitions are disposed of accordingly.  Consequently,
connected Civil Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.
