04/28.05.2009</pre><p id="p_1">               This writ petitioner has been filed by the petitioner for a
                 direction to the respondent no.6 restraining him from running the
                 factory, M/s.Sun Flower Steel Industries, Isri Bazar, at Dumri as the
                 factory has been set up in the heart of the town of Isri Bazar in the
                 district of Giridih which is a densely populated area adjacent to a Jain
                 Middle School, Bhagat School and Shiv Mandir. It was also alleged
                 that the factory has been illegally established without obtaining no
                 objection certificate from the Pollution Control Board which is a gross
                 violation of the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Pollution Control Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_2">                              Show cause notices were issued to the respondent-
                 State, Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board as also respondent
                 no.6 who is the proprietor of the factory.
</p><p id="p_3">                             Learned counsel representing Jharkhand State Pollution
                 Control Board submitted that the factory had been started without no
                 objection certificate from the Pollution Control Board. However,
                 Pollution Control Board had not passed any order on the file seeking
                 no objection certificate but ultimately in May, 2009 it has also
                 refused to grant no objection certificate to the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_4">                              Learned counsel for the respondent no.6 on the other
                 hand submitted that the Pollution Control Board was legally required
                 to reject the application of the respondent no.6 seeking no objection
                 certificate within a period of four months and as per the provision of
                 the Act, the respondent-Pollution Control Board did not issue any
                 order refusing the certificate due to which an inference was drawn
                 that there is no objection on the part of the Pollution Control Board.
</p><p id="p_5">                                However, we are not concerned with this plea of the
                 Respondent no.6, counsel for the industry for although the Pollution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2.</span>
    Control Board had maintained silence on the application seeking no
    objection certificate, the respondent no.6 was legally bound to obtain
    clearance from the competent authority and the plea that a clearance
    was granted by all authorities in favour of respondent no.6 is
    strongly refuted by the counsel for the respondent-Pollution Control
    Board.
</p><p id="p_6">               Be that as it may, the fact remains that respondent no.6 has
    already preferred an appeal before the competent authority against
    the rejection of no objection certificate by the Pollution Control
    Board. Thus, the grievance raised by the petitioner already stands
    addressed by the Pollution Control Board although at a belated
    stage.
</p><p id="p_7">               In view of the rejection of no objection certificate to the
    respondent no.6 as also in view of the fact that the industry is no
    longer running now, the grievance of the petitioner ceases to
    survive.
</p><p id="p_8">               This petition, therefore, be treated as disposed of in view of
    the fact that the cause of action has been rendered infructuous.
</p>
