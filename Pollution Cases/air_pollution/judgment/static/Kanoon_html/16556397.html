      upon as a vocation which offers the joy of
      intellectual achievement, which claims the
      allegiance of unswerving honour, which

      These writ petitions are filed in public interest.

They have been filed by two learned advocates,

practicing in this Court, as petitioners, assailing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                          -: 14 :-</span>




notifications dated 30/06/2014 and 14/07/2014 issued

by the respondent-Registrar General, High Court of

Karnataka,     Bengaluru,   by      which,   the     private

respondent-advocates have been designated as senior

advocates under Section 16 of the advocates Act,

1961     (hereinafter, referred to    as "the      Act").   A

direction is also sought to frame rules for designation

of senior advocates under sub-section (2) of Section

16 of the Act, in consultation with the Bar Council of

India.

<p id="p_3">
Pleadings:

<p id="p_4">       2.    W.P.No.36789/2014 is filed by an advocate

through another advocate, while the other petition

namely,     W.P.No.35106/2014       has   been     filed    by

advocate, Sri T.N.Raghupathy, as party-in-person. It

is a matter of record that in these writ petitions,

initially, an order dated 04/08/2014 was passed

stating that the petitioners had no locus standi to file
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                          -: 15 :-</span>




a writ petition in public interest.     That order was

assailed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in Civil

Appeal No.11439/2014. By order dated 16/12/2014,

the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that some of the

issues raised in the writ petitions require consideration

and that the writ petitions were indeed filed in public

interest.   While   setting   aside   the   order   dated

04/08/2014 of this Court, a request has been made to

consider the matter on merits.        It is in the above

premise that the Writ Petitions have been heard.


</p><p id="p_5">     3.     According to the petitioners, Section 16 of

the Act provides for two classes of advocates, namely,

senior advocates and other advocates. Sub-section (2)

of Section 16 provides for designation of an advocate

as a senior advocate. Under that section, an advocate

may, with his consent, be designated as a senior

advocate, if the Supreme Court or a High Court is of

opinion that by virtue of his ability, standing at the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                           -: 16 :-</span>




Bar or special knowledge or experience in law is

deserving of such distinction. Under Section 23, a

senior advocate has a right of pre-audience in a Court

of law.   The position of a senior advocate, who has

been designated by the Supreme Court of India or

High Court, as the case may be, is one of honour,

privilege and prestigious. Although, certain restrictions

are placed by the Bar Council of India on the senior

advocates in the interest of legal profession, the

position of a senior advocate in the administration of

justice is pivotal and of importance. The restrictions

imposed on the practice of senior advocates is good

and co-terminus with the privileges extended to them

and in order to maintain high standards in advocacy.

According   to   the   petitioners,   there   are   certain

essential criteria, which have to be possessed by an

advocate in order to be designated as a senior
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                           -: 17 :-</span>




advocate, such as learning, skill, integrity, honesty,

diligence, experience etc.


</p><p id="p_6">     4.     It is the case of the petitioners that, as far

as High Court of Karnataka is concerned, no rules

have been framed for exercise of power under Section

16(2) of the Act.       But certain Norms have been

defined by a resolution of the Full Court, stipulating

certain criteria for the purpose of Section 16(2) of the

Act. That the High Court had decided to formulate a

set of rules for the purpose of designation of senior

advocates under Section 16(2) of the Act and a

Committee     was   constituted,      comprising    of   three

Hon'ble judges and certain senior advocates of this

Court and office Bearers of the Bar Council of

Karnataka and advocates' Association, Bengaluru were

invited by the Committee to its deliberations. The said

Committee,    invited   certain      advocates,    who   were

already designated as senior advocates, to make
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   -: 18 :-</span>




suggestions with regard to the rules to be drafted for

exercise of power under Section 16(2) of the Act, and

that       eleven       designated       senior      advocates,      the

Chairman of the Karnataka State Bar Council, the

President         and     General      Secretary       of    advocates

Association, Bengaluru, participated in the meeting

and exchanged their views orally as well as in writing.</p><pre id="pre_2">

It   is    stated       that    the   High    Court    of    Karnataka

Designation         of     senior     advocates        Rules,      2014,

(Draft       Rules,       2014)       were        drafted,    a     copy

of        which     is         annexed       as     Annexure-F        to

</pre><p id="p_7">W.P.No.36789/2014, which was placed before the Full

Court prior to summer vacation of 2014.                           But no

decision was taken in the matter by the Full Court as

the rules required meticulous examination. According

to the petitioners, it transpires that at about the same

time, one of the Hon'ble Judges of this Court had

circulated letter dated 23/04/2014 proposing name of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            -: 19 :-</span>




Sri Sajan Poovayya, Sri Aditya Sondhi, Sri Shashikiran

Shetty   K.   and    Sri      Prabhuling      Navadgi     K.,

(Respondents in the Writ Petitions), for designation as

senior advocates.   The said letter was placed before

the   Committee     constituted       for   designation   of

advocates as senior advocates, which Committee

resolved to place the same before the Full Court by

resolution dated 16/06/2014.          When the matter was

placed before the Full Court on 30/06/2014, the Full

Court resolved to designate the aforesaid advocates

as senior advocates.       The aforesaid resolution was

based on secret ballot by a simple majority. In fact,

along with the said four advocates, names of three

other advocates were also considered on that date,

but they were not designated as senior advocates

namely, Sri Raveendra Kolle, Sri Hashmat Pasha and

Sri B.K.Sampath Kumar. According to the petitioners,

the aforesaid four advocates are less than 45 years of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                             -: 20 :-</span>




age and were not eligible for being designated as

senior advocates as per Draft Rules, 2014.             Also,

some of the members of the Bar had not applied for

designation   as   senior     advocates,   as   they   were

awaiting finalization of the Draft Rules. According to

the petitioners, the aforesaid four advocates were

hastily and hurriedly designated as senior advocates

on the basis of secret ballot without first finalizing the

Draft Rules, 2014. The designation of the aforesaid

four advocates as senior advocates on 30/06/2014

was debated at the Bar.        As a result, one more Full

Court was convened on 10/07/2014 and eleven more

advocates were designated as senior advocates once

again, without finalizing the Draft Rules.


</p><p id="p_8">     5.    According to the petitioners, if the Draft

Rules had been finalized and they had been applied,

then fifteen advocates who are designated as senior

advocates would not have been so designated as they
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                              -: 21 :-</span>




were ineligible for such designation.               Some of the

advocates were below 45 years of age and some other

designated advocates had relatives on the Bench and

the designated advocates did not meet the standard

required under Section 16(2) of the Act. That some of

the designated advocates have not been active in

practice      and     did   not      possess    the       requisite

qualifications      for   being    designated   as        a        senior

advocate.      According to the petitioners, there was

favoritism,      nepotism,        discrimination,     unfairness,

non-transparency and monopoly in the decision of

designation      of   respondent-advocates.          It       is     also

submitted that in the case of one or two advocates,

their proposal for designation as senior advocates was

rejected recently.        Even then, the said names were

reconsidered.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">     6.       In W.P.No.35106/2014, it has been stated

that on application made by the petitioner therein, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                          -: 22 :-</span>




Registrar General, High Court of Karnataka, issued a

document titled "Norms Fixed by the High Court of

Karnataka under Section 16(2) of the advocates' Act,

1961". The said Norms were followed for designating

an advocate as a senior advocate. According to him,

the designation of senior advocates has been made by

following the aforesaid Norms, which are contrary to

Section 16(2) of the Act.     It is averred that Section

16(2) of the Act does not envisage filing an application

by an advocate seeking his designation as a senior

advocate, rather it is done on taking consent of the

advocate by the Court.    Making an application by an

advocate for the purpose of designation is anti-thesis

to sub-section (2) of Section 16 of the Act. As per the

Norms fixed by the High Court, an advocate may be

sponsored for designation as a senior advocate by: (i)

the Chief Justice or any Judge of the High Court; or

</p><p id="p_11">(ii) any two senior advocates; or (iii) an application
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                          -: 23 :-</span>




made by the advocate desiring such designation.      It

is averred that application made by an advocate

desiring to be designated as a senior advocate, is not

contemplated in Section 16(2) of the Act as the

designation is a matter of honour bestowed on an

advocate by the Court and filing an application by the

concerned advocate is not in consonance with the

manner of designation.     Therefore, Norm No.1(iii) is

opposed to sub-section (2) of Section 16 of the Act, is

the averment.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">     7.    It is also contended that sub-section (2) of

Section 16 of the Act does not contemplate a majority

decision to be taken by the High Court on the basis of

secret ballot in the matter of designation of an

advocate as a senior advocate. It is averred that the

Full Court must form an opinion on the ability,

experience, standing at the Bar of an advocate and

then confer the designation on such an advocate as a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                           -: 24 :-</span>




senior advocate. That the High Court cannot resort to

the procedure of voting by secret ballot in the matter

of designation of an advocate as a senior advocate, is

the contention. It is, next contended that the Norms

prescribe the number of years of practice at the Bar

before an advocate can be considered for designation

as   a     senior   advocate.   That      is    an      irrelevant

consideration as the same is not prescribed under

sub-section (2) of Section 16 of the Act. An advocate

of outstanding merit can be designated as a senior

advocate, irrespective of the number of years of

practice at the Bar. It is contended that the Norms

cannot be against the spirit of Section 16 of the Act. It

is also submitted that the designation must be on an

unanimous       opinion   and    secret        ballot     is   not

contemplated under sub-section (2) of Section 16 of

the Act.     That when the High Court designates an

advocate as a senior advocate, it is on the opinion of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                               -: 25 :-</span>




the Full Court and not based on favourable opinion of

a few Judges. Therefore, the designation by majority

is defective, is the averment. It is also submitted that

on account of the prevailing system, many brilliant

advocates       from    mofussil    Courts    have   not   been

honoured as senior advocates. Contending that the

procedure followed by the Full Court in designating

the advocates as senior advocates by Notification

dated 30/6/2014 and 14/07/2014 was defective and

faulty and that there was no unanimous opinion of the

Full Court in the matter, the said notifications have

been impugned.           It is also contended that in the

absence of debate by the Judges and by merely

resorting to secret ballot, the designation is not just

and proper. Petitioners have sought quashing of the

aforesaid Notifications.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">     8.        Statement of objections has been filed on

behalf    of    the    Registrar   General,   High   Court   of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                         -: 26 :-</span>




Karnataka, raising a preliminary objection to the effect

that the decision made on the administrative side of

this Court cannot be a matter of judicial review and

that only the decision-making process can be assailed.

As far as the decision-making is concerned, it is

averred that the process adopted by the Court is in

consonance with the Norms fixed by the Court under

sub-section (2) of Section 16 of the Act. The Norms

have been amended from time to time and the latest

amendment was by resolution dated 13/02/2014

passed by the Court on its administrative side.     It is

contended   that   Section   16(2)   prescribes   certain

criteria for designation of an advocate as a senior

advocate.   That section does not specifically provide

for making any rule or procedure for designation of

advocates as senior advocates.       Even Section 34 of

the Act does not contemplate that the High Court

must make rules for designation of advocates as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                          -: 27 :-</span>




senior advocates.     Though Section 49 of the Act

empowers the Bar Council of India to make rules with

regard to the manner in which seniority amongst

advocates must be determined and also the conditions

subject to which an advocate shall have the right to

practice in a Court and Section 49A of the Act

empowers the Central Government to make rules,

section 16 or Section 34 of the Act do not contemplate

the High Court making any rule with regard to

designation of advocates as senior advocates. In the

absence of such rules, the High Court has fixed a set

of Norms, which have been followed from time-to-

time in the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">     9.    The Norms prescribe that the person to be

designated as a senior advocate may be sponsored by

any of the three ways stipulated therein, that is, (i) by

the Chief Justice or any of the Judges of the High

Court: (ii) by any two senior advocates: (iii) by an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                            -: 28 :-</span>




application made by the advocate desiring to be

designated as such. Provided that in case of (i) and

</p><p id="p_18">(ii) above, written consent of the advocate concerned

shall accompany the proposal and in all the three

cases    the    advocate   concerned   shall   append    his

certificate that he has not applied to any other High

Court for being designated as senior advocate and

that no application of his has been rejected by the

High Court within the period of two years period prior

to the date of the proposal or application.


</p><p id="p_19">        10.    The process of designation is undertaken

by secret ballot by the Hon'ble Chief Justice and the

Hon'ble Judges present at the Full Court meeting and

the decision is by a simple majority. That such a

practice has been applied for a number of years by

this    Court    and   several    advocates    have     been

designated as senior advocates.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                              -: 29 :-</span><p id="p_20">




</p><p id="p_21">        11.   While admitting that a Committee of three

Hon'ble Judges was constituted for preparation of

Draft Rules or guidelines for designation of advocates

as senior advocates and a meeting was held in that

regard and suggestions from the members of the Bar

were also invited and Draft Rules were also prepared

(Annexure-R1) and certain modifications to the Draft

Rules     were    proposed      (Annexure-R2),       but,   the

modifications have not been incorporated in the Draft

Rules and neither have the Draft Rules been finalized.


</p><p id="p_22">        12.   According    to      this     respondent,     the

advocates     who   have     been       designated   as   senior

advocates ought to have practiced for atleast fifteen

years at the Bar and their age is of no relevance. That

there have been several illustrious lawyers, who have

been designated as senior advocates at a young age,

even below 45 years of age, depending on their ability

and therefore, it cannot be contended that so long as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                           -: 30 :-</span>




an advocate has not completed 45 years of age, he

cannot be designated as a senior advocate. What is

relevant is that Section 16(2) of the Act has to be

complied with and it is in that regard, the Norms have

been fixed by this Court which are in consonance with

Section 16(2) of the Act.              One such Norm is,

sponsorship of an advocate for being designated as a

senior advocate.      With regard to notification dated

30/06/2014,       Sri.Poovayya,      respondent    No.7   in

W.P.No.36789/2014 was sponsored by one of the

Hon'ble Judges of this Court by his letter pursuant to

norm 1(i) of the Norms and respondent Nos.8 to 10 in

W.P.No.36789/2014 were sponsored by letters issued

by two senior advocates in each of those cases,

pursuant to norm 1(ii).        The Norms were considered

on 26/06/2014 and a decision was taken to designate

four advocates as senior advocates by secret ballot.

Each   of   the    aforesaid    four   advocates   received
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                 -: 31 :-</span>




overwhelming majority of votes from the Hon'ble

Judges present at the meeting and beyond the simple

majority     and       consequently,             notification    dated

30/06/2014 was issued.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">      13.   With       regard         to         notification    dated

14/07/2014, by which respondent Nos.11 to 18 and

respondent       No.20     in      W.P.No.36789/2014             were

designated, it was on the basis of letters issued by

two senior advocates sponsoring their names, which is

pursuant to norm No.1(ii) of the Norms. Respondent

No.19 and 21 submitted applications pursuant to norm

No.1(iii)   of   the    Norms.             The     names    of   these

respondents      were     considered         by      Full   Court   on

11/11/2014 and by secret ballot, the designations

were made in respect of those persons, who received

votes beyond simple majority.                     Thus, respondent

Nos.11 to 21 were designated as senior advocates.

Many other advocates who did not secure the simple
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                          -: 32 :-</span>




majority in the secret ballot were not designated.

Thus, it is contended that the designations do not

suffer from any illegality.     That the designation of

advocates, by adopting the system of secret ballot and

on the basis of simple majority is in accordance with

the prevailing Norms, and does not suffer from any

illegality so as to be challenged in a public interest

litigation, is the averment.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">     14.   In this regard, the case of Sri Sampat

Anand Shetty, advocate, has been adverted to.        The

said advocate had filed W.P. (Civil) No.176/2013

before the Hon'ble Supreme Court assailing the

process adopted by the Full Court in the designation of

senior advocates, as a result of which he was not

designated.   It was contended in that petition that

secret ballot was not envisaged under sub-section (2)

of Section 16 of the Act.      The said writ petition was

dismissed by order dated 30/08/2013 and Review
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                          -: 33 :-</span>




Petition (C) No.2666/2013, filed thereafter, was also

dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India on

27/11/2013. It is contended that the grounds urged

in that writ petition are similar to the grounds urged in

the present case and therefore these Writ Petitions

may be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">     15.   It is further contended that the procedure

adopted for designation of senior advocates vide

notifications dated 30/06/2014 and 14/07/2014 have

been in accordance with law and that the designation

has not been made in a hurried or hasty manner. The

Norms which have been fixed by the High Court are in

accordance with sub-section (2) of Section 16 of the

Act. Consequently, there is no by-passing of any rule

or regulation. It is also averred that the writ petitions

have been filed based on hearsay information and are

in bad taste.   It has also been contended that the

process of designation of senior advocates in India
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                         -: 34 :-</span>




cannot be compared with what           is prevailing in

Australia or in England and therefore, the parallel

drawn with those countries is inappropriate. It is also

submitted   that   averments       regarding   nepotism,

favouritism etc., made in the petitions are in bad

taste.   That this Court, after deliberation, put the

names of the advocates to be designated as senior

advocates to a process of secret ballot, which is one of

the most fair and transparent methods which could

have been adopted by this Court. It is averred that

most High Courts in the country and the Hon'ble

Supreme Court also follow the process of secret ballot

in the designation of advocates as senior advocates.

While denying the other averments, it has been

contended that the designation of senior advocates in

the instant case has been on the basis of the criteria

mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 16 of the Act

and that the stipulation suggested by the petitioners
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                          -: 35 :-</span>




with regard to the number of appearances of the

advocate in each Court is an impractical stipulation as

what has to be seen is the overall performance of the

advocate in light of sub-section (2) of Section 16.


</p><p id="p_29">     16.   It is next contended that absence of rules

prohibit designation of advocates as senior advocates,

is not correct. Norms have existed for several years

regarding designation of senior advocates and the Full

Court has been following those Norms by making

appropriate amendments thereto. Also the norm with

regard to application by persons desirous of getting

designated as senior advocates is not an incongruous

practice, and that the said practice has been followed

by many High Courts in the country and also by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court.     It is also admitted that the

Rules of 2014 were drafted, but in view of several

suggestions made by certain members of the Bar as

well as certain Hon'ble Judges, those Rules were not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                              -: 36 :-</span>




finalized. At that juncture, the Committee constituted

to     designate    senior    advocates       considered   the

applications of respondent Nos.7 to 10 and resolved to

refer the same to the Full Court and consequently, the

Full Court resolved to designate respondent Nos. 7 to

10 as senior advocates. It is true that on 26/6/2014

only    seven      names     were       considered   and   four

advocates, namely respondent Nos.7 to 10, were

designated.     While denying various other allegations

made in the writ petitions, it has been averred that

although some of the advocates designated as senior

advocates are the sons of retired Judges of this Court,

the parentage of the advocate cannot be a bar for his

or her designation as a senior advocate, if he or she

had eligibility of being designated as senior advocate.


</p><p id="p_30">       17.   That filing of an application by an advocate

for the purpose of designation as a senior advocate is

implied in the expression "an advocate may, with his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                         -: 37 :-</span>




consent, be designated as senior advocate" in Section

</p><p id="p_31">16.   But the designation need not be only on the

application made by an advocate.         It is denied that

there was any legal malice in the decision-making

process by the Full Court or that the process adopted

was neither fair nor reasonable as per Section 16 of

the Act. It is also denied that this Court, in a hurried

manner,    without   assessing     the    ability   of   the

advocates, designated respondent Nos.7 to 21 as

senior advocates, which is contrary to the precedent

hitherto. It is also denied that an advocate cannot be

designated as a senior advocate or appointed as a

Judge if he has not completed 45 years of age. It is

contended that if a name of a particular advocate is

rejected and not considered for being designated as a

senior advocate, then it is a discretion of the Full

Court to reconsider the names even before the expiry

of two years.   While denying the other averments in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                             -: 38 :-</span>




respect    of   certain   respondents,   who   have   been

designated as senior advocates and by contending

that the impugned designations are in accordance with

law, dismissal of the petitions has been sought by the

Registrar General.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">     18.    Statement of objections have been filed by

advocates' Association, Bangalore, contending that the

power to designate an advocate as a senior advocate

is traceable to Section 16(2) of the Act. However, no

rules have been framed for the purpose of designation

of senior advocates. But certain norms are being

followed from time-to-time. Annexure "C" to the writ

petition are the Norms.            The Norms have been

formulated by a resolution of the Full Court, which do

not have force of law and are at best, self governance

norms, but on the other hand, rules are in the nature

of subordinate legislation and have the force of law.

The High Court had constituted a Committee of three
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                            -: 39 :-</span>




Hon'ble Judges to examine the matter of framing rules

on   receiving      suggestions       from     certain   senior

advocates. The Draft Rules were placed before this

Court on the administrative side for its approval in

April 2014, but the draft rules were not approved at

that time.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">     19.     When    the   matter      stood    thus,    certain

proposals to designate advocates as senior advocates

were made by this Court as per notifications at

Annexure "A" and "B" to the writ petition.                 This

exercise of power is arbitrary as it has been done in

undue haste. The impugned designation of advocates

as senior advocates, is a departure from the Norms

laid down by the Court.       That some Hon'ble Judges

had expressed that a hurried consideration of the

proposals would not auger well for the Institution but

over- ruling such objection and by resorting to secret

ballot, the Full Court initially approved four names for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                           -: 40 :-</span>




designation of senior advocates as per Annexure "A"

and in a period of two weeks thereafter, 11 other

advocates were designated as senior advocates as per

Annexure "B".     That this Court has not formed an

opinion regarding the ability, standing at the Bar,

special knowledge or experience in law, when it

considered the names of advocates for designation as

senior    advocates. That      a    transparent      system    of

designation ought to have been adopted by this Court.

That the procedure of secret ballot has lead to a lot of

speculation    and   "horse        trading".    According      to

respondent No.6, lack of transparency in the selection

process may dissuade many deserving advocates from

seeking    designation,   as   they     do     not   have     the

inclination to "lobby" among the members of the Full

Court. That many Hon'ble sitting and former Judges

have taken an active part in "canvassing" for one or

more candidates for designation. Such practices ought
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                          -: 41 :-</span>




to be deprecated. Canvassing by the candidates or by

any Judge, sitting or former, must be regarded as a

disqualification. That the practice of advocates filing

applications seeking designation if necessary, must be

discontinued and designation as senior advocates may

be on recommendation of the Judges and by the

decision of the Full Court.   The sixth respondent has

sought for a direction for the formulation of rules for

designation of senior advocates under Section 16 of

the Act and to take such other remedial measures

which are appropriate.
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">     20.   The aforesaid statement of objections were

sought to be withdrawn by respondent Bar Association

and initially, a memorandum followed by an affidavit

was filed by the General Secretary of respondent Bar

Association. Objections to the memorandum have

been filed on behalf of the petitioners, contending that

the respondent No.6 cannot withdraw statement of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                             -: 42 :-</span>




objections at the stage when the matter was set down

for judgment after completion of arguments on both

sides.    Petitioners    sought        for    rejection    of   the

memorandum and also the affidavit. Rejoinder to the

objections of the petitioners to the memorandum filed

by the respondent No.6 have also been filed in

support    of   the    withdrawal       of   the    statement    of

objections.
</p>
<p id="p_38">

petitioner to the statement of objections filed by

respondent Registrar General.                It is stated in the

rejoinder that the said respondent has suppressed

certain material facts in his statement of objections

including the note of one of the Hon'ble Judges styled,

"Clarification by Justice N.Kumar" and another Note,

of Justice N.Kumar regarding the age of advocates to

be designated as senior advocates.                 That these two

documents       were    produced         before      the   Hon'ble

Supreme Court in Transfer Petition No.1838/2014. It

is also stated that petitioner had sought certain

information by filing an application before the Public

Information Officer and Deputy Registrar of this Court,

but the information was not furnished and the matter

is before the State Information Commission. That the

decision of the Full Court in designating certain

advocates as senior advocates impugned in the writ

petition lacks bona fides, as it was taken in a hurry in

order to favour some of the respondent advocates

herein. That when Draft Rules had been framed under

Section 16(2) of the Act, prior to finalization of those

rules the impugned designations have been made as

some of the respondent - advocates would have been

ineligible if the Rules had been followed. That the

impugned designations were done hurriedly in favour

of certain respondents herein and in respect of some

other respondents, the distinction of senior advocates
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                -: 44 :-</span>




was conferred even without satisfying as to whether

those advocates were eligible or not under Section

16(2) of the Act.

<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">     22.    Rejoinder         has   been     filed    by     learned

advocate,    Sri    T.N.Raghupathy,          stating       that   the

objection statement lacks transparency and to verify

the correctness of the statements made therein, it is

necessary to call for the records of the entire

proceedings concerning the two notifications which are

challenged in this writ petition.          That the High Court

has failed to exercise power vested in it under Section

16(2) of the Act by not inviting eminent advocates to

accept designation as senior advocates. Such a step

was taken in the year 2003 when 15 advocates were

designated as senior advocates after taking their oral

consent.    But    in   the    instant     case,     none    of   the

advocates have been called to accept the designation.

All of them have applied enclosing recommendatory
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                              -: 45 :-</span>




letters of    two   senior    advocates. The   expression

sponsored according to Black's Law Dictionary means

"one who intervenes for another voluntarily and

without being requested". But in the instant case, the

recommendatory letters have been given by the

senior advocates at the request of the advocates

seeking designation.     The names of two advocates

namely Sri Hashmath Pasha and Sri Pradeep Sawkar

have been unjustly rejected by the High Court.       The

High Court has also ignored the claim of certain

women advocates and the application of the sole

women advocate has been rejected without giving any

reason.

Submissions:
</p>
<p id="p_43">     23.     Sri T.N.Raghupathy, learned advocate, who

has appeared in person, drew our attention to the

Norms fixed by the High Court of Karnataka under

Section 16(2) of the Act. That in the Norms fixed by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                             -: 46 :-</span>




the High Court, the names of the advocates for being

designated    as    the    senior      advocates    could   be

sponsored in three ways: i) by the Chief Justice or the

Judges of the High Court; ii) by any two senior

advocates; iii) by an application made by the advocate

desiring to be designated as such.            In the case of

</p><p id="p_44">i) and ii), written consent of the advocate concerned

has to be appended to his certificate that he has not

applied to any other High Court for being designated

as senior advocates.       Also, he has to certify that no

application of his has been rejected by the High Court

within a period of two years prior to the date of the

proposal or application. He contended that in the

instant   case,    the    advocates     who   had    obtained

recommendatory letters from two senior advocates to

be annexed to the documents submitted by them

were not really sponsorship by the senior advocates.

They were mere certificates issued at the request of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                        -: 47 :-</span>




the   advocate              seeking       designation            as   a   senior

advocate.         They were not really sponsorship by the

senior advocates as the senior advocates had not

certified for the purpose of sponsoring the names of

the advocates but it was on the request of the

concerned advocates seeking designation as senior

advocates.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">      24.        He also contended that the Norms were

contrary to Section 16(2) of the Act as an application

cannot be filed by the advocate to seek designation as

a senior advocate as contemplated in Norm (1)(iii).

But sponsorship by the Chief Justice or any of the

Judges      of    the        High      Court       may      be    correct.   He

elaborated his submission by contending that under

Section 16(2) of the Act, an opinion has to be formed

by the High Court that, by virtue of his or her ability,

standing         at        the   Bar     or       special    knowledge        or

experience            in     law,   an        advocate       deserves        the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                              -: 48 :-</span>




distinction of being designated as a senior advocate.

Of course, while so designating an advocate, as a

senior   advocate,     the     consent     of   the    advocate

concerned must be taken. Also, there is no reason to

restrict the names being placed before the Full Court

from only the aforesaid three avenues.


</p><p id="p_47">      25.     Sri   Raghupathy,         contented     that   the

prevalent Norms take away the power of the High

Court to form an opinion under Section 16(2). He also

contended that an advocate with self respect would

not apply to be designated as a senior advocate and

that the designation must be by sponsorship or by

invitation.
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><p id="p_49">      26.     Sri N.Devhadass, learned senior advocate,

appearing for the petitioners in W.P.No.36789/2014

drew our attention to the Notes circulated by Hon'ble

Kumar J. and contended that the senior advocates
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                               -: 49 :-</span>




could not be designated on the basis of likes and

dislikes    of   individual    Judges.     According    to    him,

the method of secret ballot is based on likes and

dislikes    of   the   advocates,        who   had   sought     for

designation as senior advocates. That there has been

no   conscientious      vote     cast     by   the   Full    Court.

Therefore, the proceedings of the Full Court meetings

would have to be looked into in order to ascertain as

to what transpired in the Full Court meetings as

designations at two stages have been made in a

hurried manner.
</p>
<p id="p_50">
</p><p id="p_51">      27.    Learned senior advocate, Sri Naganand,

who has appeared for the advocates' Association

contended that Section 16(2) of the Act does not

contemplate exercise of a secret ballot.               There has

been no discussion about the advocates who had

sought for designation as senior advocates. That it is

not apparent as to why certain advocates were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                         -: 50 :-</span>




designated as senior advocates while certain others

were not designated.    The procedure of applications

by advocates for the purpose of designation as senior

advocates is not a correct procedure.          In the instant

case, where the designations have been made on the

basis of applications submitted by the advocates and

on the basis of secret ballot cannot be accepted and

therefore, the status-quo ante has to be restored.

After formulating the rules for designation of senior

advocates, the Full Court could reconsider the names

of respondent - advocates as senior advocates, on the

basis of the rules, was the submission.


</p><p id="p_52">     28.   Countering    the       aforesaid     arguments,

Sri Udaya Holla, learned senior counsel, appearing for

the Registrar General of the High Court, at the outset,

contended that Section 16(2) of the Act clearly

indicates the criteria, on the basis of which, an

advocate could be designated as a senior advocate.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                            -: 51 :-</span>




Merely because rules or regulations have not been

framed, under that Section, it would not imply that

this Court does not have the authority to exercise

power under Section 16(2) of the Act.                 It was

contended that even if a statute requires rules to be

framed for the exercise of powers under a particular

provision, in the absence of rules being framed, an

authority is not barred from exercising power under

the provision of the statute. He submitted that

whatever Norms or guidelines were prevalent, were

applied, to the respondent - advocates, who have

been designated as senior advocates. The Full Court

has   acted    in   accordance    with    Section   16(2)    of

the Act even in the absence of there being rules or

regulations     framed     in    that    regard,    was     the

submission.
</p>
<p id="p_53">
</p><p id="p_54">      29.     He next contended that there is no illegality

in the Full Court designating the advocates as senior
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                         -: 52 :-</span>




advocates on the basis of secret ballot.      That the

process of secret ballot has been in vogue in the High

Courts of Bombay, Madras and Allahabad. Also, it is

only when advocates who seek designation as senior

advocates comply with the prevalent norms, would

their names be placed before the Full Court for the

purpose of designation. The prevalent Norms could be

construed to be rules or regulations under Section

16(2) of the Act; that section 16(2) of the Act itself

prescribes certain guidelines and based on those

guidelines, the Norms have been framed by the High

Court, on the basis of which, the designations have

been made in the instant case.       Merely because the

Full Court resorted to secret ballot and on the basis of

the majority of the votes cast, designations have been

made, it cannot be judged to be an illegal or improper

process, was the submission.       That each Judge may

have his or her opinion about an advocate who has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                            -: 53 :-</span>




sought for designation as a senior advocate and

possibly, in order to avoid any acrimony in the Full

Court wherein, contrary opinions would be expressed

and in order to maintain a cordial atmosphere, the Full

Court may have designated the advocates as senior

advocates, based on the secret ballot.                  He also

contended that it is not necessary for the Full Court to

give reasons as to why certain advocates were not

designated as senior advocates or, for that matter,

why   certain     others   were       designated   as     senior

advocates. The collective opinion of the Full Court is

expressed by means of the secret ballot. He therefore

contended that there is no merit in these matters.


</p><p id="p_55">      30.   Sri   D.L.N.Rao,    learned     senior      counsel,

appearing for some of the respondent-advocates

contended that one cannot be judgmental in these

matters.    The correctness or otherwise of the Norms

are not justiciable.   The Norms are not amenable to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                               -: 54 :-</span>




judicial review.    It is based on the prevalent Norms

that the applications from advocates interested in

seeking designation as senior advocates were received

by the Registry.      There was no invitation from the

Registry of this Court to any advocate to apply and

the advocates themselves have applied.            Therefore,

there is no      illegality    in the designation of     the

advocates as senior advocates, was the contention.


</p><p id="p_56">     31.   Sri     Ashok      Haranahalli,   learned   senior

counsel, appearing for a few respondent - advocates

also contended that the designation of advocates as

senior advocates is not a justiciable matter; that the

Full Court has considered the suitability of advocates

for being designated as senior advocates and on that

basis, the designation has taken place. Moreover, the

prevalent Norms are an inbuilt check on the exercise

of power under Section 16(2) of the Act and so long

as the designation has been made in accordance with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                           -: 55 :-</span>




the prevalent Norms, there can be no interference in

the matter, was the submission.

</p><p id="p_58">     32.    Sri D.N.N.Reddy, learned senior counsel,

appearing for respondent No.7 in W.P.No.36789/2014

submitted that the said respondent did not make any

application and his consent was sought by one of the

Hon'ble Judges for the purpose of considering his

name as a senior advocate. The Full Court has taken

a decision to designate him as a senior advocate by a

majority vote.       This is based on the subjective

satisfaction of the individual Judges. The same cannot

be justiciable in a Court of law, was the submission.


</p><p id="p_59">     33.    In reply, Sri T.N.Raghupathy, contended

that reference made to the procedure adopted by the

Court in New South Wales Australia by learned

counsel    for   respondent   Registrar   General   is not

correct, as in India senior advocates are made by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                            -: 56 :-</span>




designation by the High Court whereas, in New South

Wales, it is by appointment in which case, there has to

be an application. There is also a consideration by the

Bar Association therein, which is not so in India and

therefore, the procedure in New South Wales and

in   India   are   not   analogous.     He   submitted   that

ultimately, the spirit of Section 16(2) of the Act must

be followed. But, the statement of objections filed on

behalf of the Bar Association clearly reveals the

feelings of the Bar and that the designation of

advocates on two different dates and selection of only

a few advocates for being considered for designation

on 26/06/2014 was not correct, was his submission.

He    therefore     contended         that   the   impugned

designations may be quashed and the matter may be

reconsidered.

his reply reiterated that there is unexplained hurry in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                             -: 57 :-</span>




considering only a few names in the first instance

leaving aside the other applications filed by the other

applicants and that is the main grievance of the Bar.

He submitted that the records could be looked into to

ascertain as to why only names of a few advocates

were considered in the first instance leaving aside the

other    applications.    Therefore,   petitioners     counsel

prayed for grant of relief in the writ petitions.

withdrawal of statement of objections filed on behalf

</p><p id="p_91">       42.    At the outset, it is noted that the existing

Norms have not been assailed in these writ petitions.

Only    the      Notifications   dated   30/06/2014         and

14/07/2014 have been assailed.               In both the writ

petitions, directions have been sought for the framing

of new norms or rules in consonance with Section

16(2) of the Act and thereafter, to reconsider the

respondent - advocates for designation as senior

advocates, by orally contending that the Norms are

not in accordance with Section 16(2) of the Act.


</p><p id="p_92">       43.    Thus, at this stage, it is inferred that on the

one hand, there is no challenge to the existing norms

in the pleadings although, during the course of

submission it was vaguely submitted that the norms

are not in accordance with Section 16(2) of the Act.

On the other hand, the petitioners are seeking fresh

Norms or Rules to be framed for the purpose of

Re: Point No.1:
</p>
<p id="p_104">     45.   On the petitioner's side, it was seriously

contended that in the absence of rules being framed

under Section 16(2) of the Act, this Court had no

power to designate advocates as senior advocates. It

was contended that when steps were taken for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                              -: 66 :-</span>




drafting    of   new   rules,    this     Court,    prior   to    the

promulgation      of   the   new        rules    could   not     have

designated       advocates      as      senior     advocates.      In

substance, the contention of the petitioners was that

in the absence of the rules being made under Section

16(2) of the Act, this Court was not empowered to

make the impugned designations. On behalf of the

respondents it was submitted that even in the absence

of rules, this Court could exercise power under Section

16(2) of the Act.        Also, in the instant case, the

prevalent Norms were applied and therefore, it was

not a case of total absence of guidance.                    It was

contended that Section 16(2) of the Act had sufficient

criteria engrafted in it, which was a substantial guide

for the purpose of expressing an opinion by the Court

in the matter of designation of an advocate as a senior

advocate.

</p><p id="p_106">     46.   In this regard, learned senior counsel,

Sri Udaya Holla, submitted that even if a particular

statute prescribes framing of rules for exercise of

powers under the statute, the absence of rules would

not bar exercise of power under the statute. In this

regard, the following citations were adverted to:-


</p><p id="p_107">     (a)   <a href="/doc/1161634/" id="a_1">Orissa State (Prevention &amp; Control of

Pollution) Board vs. Orient Paper Mills and

Another</a> [2003 (10) SCC 421] - The said case arose

under <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_2">Section 19</a> of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.   The State Government under

<a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_4">Section 19</a> of the said Act could exercise power to

declare any area as air pollution control area. In the

absence of rules prescribing the manner for declaring

an area to be an air pollution control area, whether

publication of a valid notification under <a href="/doc/63638378/" id="a_5">Section 19(1)</a>

in the Official Gazette was legal or not, was the

question. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that non
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                         -: 68 :-</span>




framing of rules does not curtail the power of the

State Government and by virtue of <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_6">Section 19</a> of the

aforesaid Act, State Government was authorized to

declare any area as air pollution control area by

means of a notification published in the Official

Gazette. It also held that simply because rules have

not been framed prescribing the manner of declaration

of air pollution control areas, it would not render

<a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_7">Section 19</a> inoperative. Thus, when a power is vested

in an authority under the statute, it would not cease

to exist simply for the reason that rules have not been

framed or the manner of exercise of power has not

been prescribed, were the observations of the Hon'ble

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_108">
</p><p id="p_109">     In the aforesaid case, it has been also held that

if rules are framed, the powers so conferred on

authority could be exercised in accordance with the

rules. But if no rules are framed, the authority is not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                          -: 69 :-</span>




precluded from exercising the powers conferred under

the statute. It was further held that if the legislative

intent is that until the rules are framed, there could be

no exercise of power, then the said intent would be

expressly made in the statute. But in the absence of

any such express provision, framing of rules cannot be

a condition precedent for exercise of power under a

statute.

Hon'ble Supreme Court held that it is a well settled

principle of law that even in a case where the statute

provides for certain things to be done, subject to

rules, any action taken without framing the rules

would not render that action invalid.    If a statute is

workable even without framing of the rules, the same
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                             -: 70 :-</span>

of the Constitution, that in the absence of a specific

rule made under that Article, the prevalent practice

could be taken into consideration.             Similarly, in the

absence    of   statutory    rules,     executive    orders    or

administrative instructions could be made.

be open to the State Government in exercise of its

executive power under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_12">Article 162</a> of the Constitution,

to prescribe in the same field an executive order.

However, it is well recognized that in matters relating

to a particular    subject, in the absence of any

Parliamentary legislation on the said subject, the

State Government has jurisdiction to act and to make

executive orders, where the subjects are in List II or

III of the VII schedule of the Constitution.            The

executive power of the State would, in the absence of

legislation,   extend   to      making   rules   or   orders

regulating the action of the executive.          But, such

orders cannot offend the provisions of the Constitution

and should not be repugnant to any enactment of the

Parliament. Subject to these limitations, such rules or

classification and may determine the conditions of

eligibility for receiving any advantage, privilege or aid

from the State.

judicial precedents is that exercise of power under a

provision of a statute is not dependent upon the

framing of rules unless, the legislative intent is, to the

contrary.    If the Parliament prescribes in the statute

itself, that no action shall be taken under a particular

provision of a statute until and unless rules are

framed in that regard, then the authority concerned is

precluded from exercising powers under the statute.

In the instant case, <a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_22">Section 16</a> does not prescribe any

such    Parliamentary    intention.   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_23">Under    the   Act</a>,

sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/125761245/" id="a_24">Section 34</a> states that the High

Court may make rules laying down conditions, subject

to which, an advocate shall be permitted to practice in

the High Court and the Courts subordinate thereto.

The expression "advocate" in sub-section (1) of

<a href="/doc/125761245/" id="a_25">Section 34</a> means "an advocate entered in any roll

under the provisions of the Act [<a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_26">Section 2(1)(a)</a>].
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                          -: 75 :-</span>




Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/125761245/" id="a_27">Section 34</a> is not a mandatory

provision but is directory in nature.     Also, the said

provision deals with advocates in general and not with

the aspect of designation of advocates as senior

advocates.     Designation of senior advocates is in

<a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_28">Section 16(2)</a> of the Act.           Therefore, it is not

incumbent upon the High Court to frame rules before

designation of an advocate as a senior advocate could

be made by it.     On the other hand, the aforesaid

judgments clearly enunciate that when a statute

prescribes making rules for exercise of power or

taking any action under a particular provision, in the

absence of rules being framed, exercise of power is

not illegal.   That apart, as far as this Court is

concerned, Norms have been framed and amended

from time to time.   The prevalent Norms have been

applied in the case of the impugned designations.

Therefore, it is not a case of there being absolutely no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                         -: 76 :-</span>




guidance to the Full Court in the matter of designation

of the respondent - advocates.         The impugned

designations have not been made in a vacuum.

Whether the designations are made bypassing the

ingredients in <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_29">Section 16(2)</a> of the Act, which itself

enunciates the essential criteria required for the

designation of an advocate as a senior advocate, is an

aspect which is also discussed.
</p>
<p id="p_121">
</p><p id="p_122">     48.   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_30">The   Act</a>   recognizes   two    classes   of

advocates, who are eligible to practice namely, senior

advocates and other advocates.       Initially, all law

graduates, who are enrolled at the Bar council are

called as advocates.   With the passage of time, an

advocate could be designated as a senior advocate.

The designation could be made either by the Supreme

Court or the High Court.      If in the opinion of the

Court, an advocate is, by virtue of (i) his ability and

</p><p id="p_123">(ii) standing at the Bar or special knowledge or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                           -: 77 :-</span>




experience in law, is deserving of such distinction,

he/she could be conferred such distinction, with the

consent of that advocate.        The crucial ingredients of

<a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_31">Section 16</a> (2) are as follows: (a) opinion of the

Supreme Court or High Court on (i) ability of an

advocate;    (ii)   standing   at     the    Bar   or   special

knowledge or experience in law of the advocate, (b)

by virtue of which, he or she is deserving of a

distinction of a designation as a senior advocate and

</p><p id="p_124">(c) consent of the advocate for being designated as a

senior advocate.     Thus, the opinion of the Supreme

Court or the High Court must be on two aspects,

namely, ability of the advocate and standing at the

Bar or special knowledge or experience in law, and the

opinion must be towards an advocate deserving

conferment of a distinction as a senior advocate.


</p><p id="p_125">     49.    The     expression        "ability"    relates    to

competence     or   capacity     of    an   advocate.        The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">                            -: 78 :-</span>




advocate's competence vis-à-vis his knowledge of law,

manner of conducting cases, advocacy skills in Court

and such other aspects which would encompass the

expression    "professional     competence"       is   to   be

considered.    The expression "standing at the Bar or

special knowledge or experience in law" would mean

that a person, who has the ability, must also have a

professional standing at the Bar.           By this, it means

that the advocate, apart from being competent and

able, is known for his professional integrity, a person

who would uphold and follow professional ethics and

would generally be a person of impeccable reputation.

In short the expression "ability and standing at the

Bar" have been used in <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_32">Section 16(2)</a> of the Act, to

relate to not only competence, but also to the

reputation    and   qualities   of    the   advocate   to   be

designated as a senior advocate. Thus, the advocate,

who has not only the ability or professional capacity
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                             -: 79 :-</span>




but who also has standing at the Bar i.e., who

possesses the requisite qualities of a senior advocate,

a person who upholds professional ethics, and who, in

the opinion of the Supreme Court or the High Court,

deserves to be designated as a senior advocate, may

be so designated after seeking his or her consent.


</p><p id="p_126">     50.    What emerges is that even if an advocate

has ability in practice but has no standing at the Bar,

cannot     be     designated     as     a    senior    advocate.

Conversely, an advocate may have a standing at the

Bar but who does not have the ability and professional

competence cannot also be conferred the distinction of

a senior advocate. Parliament has been conscious to

include    not   only    professional       competence    of   an

advocate    but    has    also   taken       into   consideration

professional ethics for the purpose of conferment of

designation as a senior advocate.            Therefore, even if

an advocate has the ability but has no standing at the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                           -: 80 :-</span>




Bar or lacks integrity and character, cannot be

designated as a senior advocate. In the same way, an

advocate who may have a standing at the Bar, may be

ethically good, but not having professional ability,

cannot also be designated as a senior advocate.


</p><p id="p_127">     51.   Thus, professional ability or competence

and standing at the Bar, are two sides of the same

coin and it is only when an advocate, in the opinion of

the Supreme Court or High Court possesses both

these virtues, he or she could be designated as a

senior   advocate   and   he    would    deserve   such   a

distinction. If either of the two aspects is absent in an

advocate he/she cannot be conferred the designation

as a senior advocate.     In our view, <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_33">Section 16(2)</a> of

the Act enshrines sufficient guidelines for the purpose

of forming an opinion by the Supreme Court or the

High Court in the matter of designation of an advocate

as   a   senior   advocate.    Ability   and   professional
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">                         -: 81 :-</span>




competence and standing at the Bar are matters

which have to be taken into consideration by the

Court while considering the name of a particular

advocate for being designated as a senior advocate,

as almost every Judge would have assessed the

qualities of an advocate on a daily basis, as and when

the advocates appears before a particular Court. With

regard to qualities of an advocate, it would be useful

to quote Chief    Justice Warren E.Burger, of the

Supreme Court of United States of America and

Sri.Nani A Palkhivala, an eminent jurist of this

Country:

Government of A.P</a>. [AIR 1987 SC 1550], it has

been held that by virtue of the pre-eminence which

senior counsel enjoy in the profession, they not only

carry greater responsibilities but they also act as a

model to the junior members of the profession.       A

senior counsel more or less occupies a position akin to

a Queen's counsel in England next after the Attorney

General and the Solicitor General. It is an honour and

privilege conferred on advocates of standing and

experience by the Chief Justice and the Judges of the

Supreme Court.     They thus become leading counsel

and take precedence on all counsel not having the

rank. Senior advocates on designation, are subject to

certain restrictions which the Bar Council of India

would prescribe. Those restrictions are in the interest

of legal profession.

contemplated in <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_35">Section 16(2)</a> of the Act, this Court

thought it fit to frame certain Norms for the purpose

of designation of advocates under <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_36">Section 16(2)</a> of the

Act. Briefly speaking, the Norms are on the following

aspects: certain norms are regarding the procedure to

be followed for designation of an advocate as a senior

advocate; while certain other norms relate to the

criteria mentioned in <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_37">Section 16(2)</a> of the Act.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">                          -: 86 :-</span>




</p><p id="p_137">     54.    Clause (1) of the norms deals with the

sponsorship of an advocate for being designated as a

senior advocate. An advocate could be sponsored (i)

by the Chief Justice or any of the Judges of the High

Court; or (ii) by any two senior advocates; or (iii) by

the advocate concerned himself or herself making an

application for being designated as a senior advocate.

In the case of first two kinds of sponsorship, written

consent of the advocate concerned must accompany

the proposal and in all the three cases, the advocate

concerned must certify that he has not applied to any

other High Court for being designated as a senior

advocate and that no application has been rejected by

the High Court within a period of two years prior to

the date or proposal or application.        The object of

Clause (1) of the norms is to provide three different

avenues for an advocate to be designated as a senior

advocate.     The   initiative   for   designation   of   an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">                           -: 87 :-</span>




advocate as a senior advocate could be from any

member of the Bench or, from two senior advocates of

the Bar or, by the advocate concerned, suo motu

seeking such a designation by making an application.

We do not find any legal lacuna in prescribing three

different avenues for initiation of the process of

designation of an advocate as a senior advocate. The

judges of this Court or the senior advocates at the Bar

may not have bestowed their attention on a particular

advocate for the purpose of designation as a senior

advocate. In such a situation an advocate may bring

to   the notice of    the Court      his   candidature for

designation as a senior advocate.          This cannot be

condemned      as    an   instance    of    hankering   for

designation.    It is simply an avenue/channel of

receiving names by the Court for the purpose of

consideration for designation as a senior advocate. In

the case of Clause 1(iii), an advocate may also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                           -: 88 :-</span>




enclose    recommendatory            letters    from      senior

advocates in support of his application.


</p><p id="p_138">     55.   Clause   (2)   and        (3)(iv)   of   the   Norms

prescribes the manner in which the designation may

be made.    It is by a secret ballot on the basis of

simple majority of the Judges present and voting in

the Full Court meeting held to designate an advocate

as a senior advocate in terms of <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_38">Section 16(2)</a> of the

Act. Such a majority could be discerned by an open

ballot, by voice vote or show of hands or by a secret

ballot, which makes no difference to the result. But,

when there are differences of opinion amongst the

Chief Justice and the Judges of the Court vis-à-vis,

designation of an advocate as a senior advocate in our

view, it is prudent to have a secret ballot rather than

having a voice vote, so as to maintain a cordial

atmosphere during the Full Court Meeting and have a

free play of independent judgment.              Therefore the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                         -: 89 :-</span>

proper.
</p>
<p id="p_139">
</p><p id="p_140">     56.   Norm (3) prescribes certain qualifications

to be possessed by an advocate seeking designation

as a senor advocate.     They are: (i) should have a

minimum standing of 15 years of active practice in the

Courts; (ii) should be an Income Tax assessee for 10

years preceding the date of consideration of his case

for designation as senior advocate.     (iii) the annual

gross income through legal profession should not be

less than Rs.3 lakhs for the past 5 years. (iv) To give

due weightage to the advocates who have done a

certain minimum number of cases as a Legal Aid

counsel. The aforesaid parameters are only illustrative

and not exhaustive of what is stated in <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_39">Section 16(2)</a>

of the Act. Despite an advocate possessing the

aforesaid qualifications, he may still not be designated

an opinion regarding such advocate.

holding that Rule 2 of the said High Court Rules was in

conformity with <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_41">Section 16(2)</a> of the Act.    Similarly,

Rule (1) was held to be in accordance with <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_42">Section

of making the application.    It was held that when a

of such distinction. Rule 3 required an application by

an advocate while Rule 1 provided that the Chief

Justice and Judges on the basis of their opinion and

with the consent of the advocate could confer the

distinction. It was held that consent of the advocate

was required because the moment he is designated as

a senior advocate, he would be under restrictions and

a person may not like to become a designated

advocate as he would not like to be under certain

restrictions. But under Rule 3 of the said Rules, when

an application was made by an advocate seeking

conferment of such a distinction, such a consent was

not necessary for, making of the application by an

advocate itself implied that he was agreeable to

conferment of the distinction.

Registry of this Court. In the year 2011, the Registry

of this Court had received names of certain advocates

for being designated as senior advocates. In respect

of   some   advocates,    certain       Hon'ble   Judges   had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">                         -: 96 :-</span>




recommended them; while in respect of certain other

advocates,    certain     senior   advocates     had

recommended them for being designated as senior

advocates; while some other advocates had made

their individual requests for being designated as

senior advocates.

and the Norms made there under by this Court,

meeting of the Committee to consider suitability of

advocates to be designated as senior advocates was

convened on 17/11/2011 and it was noted that totally,

22 advocates (18+4) had submitted their particulars

for designation as senior advocates. No decision was

taken by the Committee on that date. Subsequently,

meeting of the Committee was held on 12/06/2012

wherein, it was resolved to recommend to the Full

Court for laying down guidelines for consideration of

the advocates to be designated as senior advocates.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">                             -: 97 :-</span>




It was further resolved to proceed with the finalization

of process of designating senior advocate on pending

applications.       The Full Court at its meeting held on

14/12/2012 resolved to direct the Registrar General to

secure the rules and guidelines framed by the other

High      Courts,     regarding     designation    of   senior

advocates as per <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_52">Section 16(2)</a> of the Act and also,

any procedure adopted by other High Courts in that

regard.     A communication was addressed to all the

High Courts in the Country by the Registrar General of

this Court requesting to furnish a copy of the

norms/guidelines, if any, framed by those Courts

regarding     designating     the      advocates   as   senior

advocates and also to intimate whether there was any

Committee constituted in that regard or the same was

being considered by the Full Court or by the Hon'ble

Chief Justice and also the procedure that was being

followed by those Courts.         In response, certain High
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">                           -: 98 :-</span>




Courts through their Registrar General had submitted

the requisite details to the Registrar of this Court. The

matter was later placed before the Full Court for

consideration.    Thereafter, the then Hon'ble Chief

Justice suggested that the Committee constituted to

consider the suitability of advocates for designation as

senior advocates may also frame rules pertinent to

such designation.

High Court in terms of <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_53">Section 16(2)</a> of the Act.            It

was further resolved that the Hon'ble Chief Justice

deliberate and prepare the draft for being placed

before the Full Court for approval after inviting

suggestions, if any, from the members and leaders of

the Bar    as also, after taking into consideration the

comparative rules framed by the other High Courts. A

Committee of three Hon'ble Judges was constituted by

the Hon'ble Chief Justice to propose draft norms and

guidelines or draft rules for the purpose of designation

deferred the matter by inviting suggestions and

modifications from other Hon'ble Judges to be given

Hon'ble Anand Byrareddy J had submitted a note on

the suggestions.    The Full Court once again deferred

Justice and the Committee was reconstituted for that

purpose consisting of the Hon'ble Chief Justice and

five    Hon'ble     Judges    and    considerable   work   was

Committee which met on 13/03/2014, resolved that a

constituted to propose draft rules or norms for the

purpose of designation of an advocate as senior

advocate by this Court in terms of <a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_54">Section 16</a> of the

Act. The Committee further resolved that the Hon'ble

Chief   Justice   shall    constitute      such    Committee.

Accordingly, a new Committee of three Hon'ble Judges

Committee     requested      certain      senior    advocates;

Chairman and Vice-chairman of Karnataka State Bar

Council,   Bangalore      and    also    the    President   and

designated as senior advocates in that meeting as

they had secured more than 50% of the votes cast in

their applications for designation as senior advocates

as adverted to supra. The names of those advocates

were considered on 11/07/2015 and 15 advocates

were designated on that day by following the same

procedure.       In    fact,    the    Committee         which   was

said Committees it becomes clear that a decision was

taken to refer the matter to the Full Court with regard

to designation of advocates as senior advocates even

prior to the finalization of new Norms or Rules by the

concerned        Committee.        Merely     because      without

completing the task of framing of Norms or Rules, by

the Committee constituted for that purpose, certain

advocates were designated as senior counsel, it

cannot be termed to be an arbitrary or an illegal act or

one lacking in transparency or any of the other

"epithets" used in the pleadings.            There was also no

hurried or hasty decision taken in the matter. Having
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">                              -: 111 :-</span>




regard to our answer to Point No.1 supra, we hold that

the action of this Court in designating the respondent

</p><p id="p_179">- advocates as senior advocates was not unguided or

in a vacuum.      We also hold that although the Court

had taken a decision to frame fresh Norms or Rules

the designations impugned herein were made in a

period   of    transition.      Moreover,       the   Committee

constituted to consider the suitability of advocates for

designation of senior advocates had decided to place

the names of all advocates before the Full Court for its

decision. The same was followed even in the case of

the   22      advocates,     who         were   designated   on

11/07/2014.

</p><p id="p_181">      78.     <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_55">Section 16(2)</a> states that designation of an

advocate as a senior advocate must be pursuant to an

opinion formed by the Supreme Court or the High

Court, as the case may be.                That means, all the

Judges of the Supreme Court or High Court as the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">                               -: 112 :-</span>




case may be, present at a meeting called for that

purpose. But in this Court, the Committee constituted

by the Hon'ble Chief Justice to consider the suitability

of the advocates for designation as senior advocates is

entrusted       with   the    function    of   scruitinizing   the

applications so as to ensure that those applications

are in accordance with the norms framed by this

Court.     The Committee has no jurisdiction to dilate

upon the suitability of the advocate in terms of

<a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_56">Section 16(2)</a> of the Act.            Once the names of the

advocates is placed before the Committee, it can at

best      scrutinize their applications and if held be

proper, then the names of the advocates have to be

forwarded to the Full Court of this Court, to form an

opinion    in    terms   of    <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_57">Section    16(2)</a>    of   the    Act.

Therefore, the aforesaid Committee has no jurisdiction

to consider the names of the advocates under <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_58">Section

16(2)</a> of the Act. Such a consideration could be made
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">                          -: 113 :-</span>




only by this Court, in presence of all the Judges at the

Full Court meeting held for that purpose.           Thus,

consideration of the names of the advocates by this

Court on 26/06/2014 was in accordance with the

resolution of the Committee.          Also, the Full Court

meeting was held to consider the names of 22

advocates who had submitted their applications and

the same were considered on 11/07/2014. It is

pertinent to note that almost all the applications of 22

advocates were filed subsequent to the Full Court

meeting held on 26/06/2014.

administrative power on the Hon'ble Supreme Court

and the High Court to designate advocates as senior

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">                         -: 114 :-</span>




principle in this regard is that, normally Courts, on the

judicial side, would not interfere or probe into the

merits of exercise of the discretion by an authority as

it is not a forum to hear appeals from the decisions of

the authority.   Consequently, the     question as to

whether the opinion formed by an authority is right or

wrong cannot be considered nor can the Court

substitute its own views with that of the concerned

authority. The authority having discretion has to draw

its own conclusions upon the material before it. The

Court also would not interfere with the subjective

satisfaction of an authority before taking a decision in

the matter unless there is irrelevant consideration,

which has crept in to the decision making process. In

fact, in any exercise of an administrative power, there

would be two elements involved i.e., an objective

judicial review where the exercise of power is based

on subjective satisfaction on certain and definite

criteria which are stated in <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_61">Section 16(2)</a> of the Act.

be assailed but not the merits of an administrative

"30.    From perusal for <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_66">Section 16(2)</a> of the
Act, it is clear that High Court has to form
an opinion about the ability, standing at the
Bar or special knowledge or experience in
law of an advocate and when he is found
deserving,        he     is     designated         as   senior
advocate. Process of forming opinion by
Hon'ble Judges of this Court is a continuous
process based on the observation of the
performance of the advocate in arguing
cases before the Judge concerned. Such
kind of opinion cannot be formed except by
long and sustained observation for years.
Opinion forming process is thus, objective.
However, it is expressed in subjective
manner by designating an advocate as
senior advocate or by refusing to confer
this       distinction.          The       expression       is
subjective        as   Hon'ble            Judges    are   not
required to assign any reasons for such
refusal. Opinion-forming is objective as the
concerned advocate appears, argues his
cases       and    his         performance         regarding
ability,     standing          at    the    Bar     and    his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">                       -: 117 :-</span>




knowledge and experience of law is judged
frequently by Hon'ble Judges. It cannot be
disputed     that    function          is     necessarily
administrative but it is statutory in nature.
Whether such kind of statutory function,
though administrative in nature, can be
delegated. There is no doubt about the
legal position that when any function is
assigned to the High Court, the High Court
means, Hon'ble the Chief Justice and all his
companion Judges. Normally administrative
functions and powers can be delegated in
favour of coordinate authority or to a
subordinate      authority.       However,            when
administrative      function      is        statutory    in
nature and the function or the power is
assigned under the statute, it should be
performed or exercised by that authority
unless the power to delegate such function
or exercise of power is specifically provided
or may be inferred by necessary implication
from   the    provisions       contained         in     the
statute."

</p><p id="p_189">      81.    In the instant case, the opinion to be

formed under <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_67">Section 16(2)</a> of the Act by the High

Court is subjective. So long as the said opinion is in

accordance with <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_68">Section 16(2)</a> of the Act, the opinion

of the High Court to designate an advocate as a senior

advocate is not a subject matter of judicial review in

so far as the merits of the opinion is concerned.


</p><p id="p_190">      82.    Accordingly, we answer Point No.2 by

holding that we do not find any infirmity in the

Notifications dated 30/6/2014 and 14/7/2014 assailed

in   these   writ   petitions   or    with   regard   to   the

proceedings held for the purpose of <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_69">Section 16(2)</a> of

the Act.

<p id="p_191">

regard to the controversy arising form the withdrawal

of the statement of objections filed by the respondent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">                           -: 119 :-</span>




the answer given by us to the aforesaid points, we feel

that it is not necessary to enter upon the merits of

that   controversy   as   it   has    now   become   wholly

academic in nature. Therefore, we can only observe

that the statement of objections initially supported the

case of the petitioners but the withdrawal of the

statement of objections shows that the Association

would like to take a neutral stand in the matter.

Withdrawal of the statement of objections does not in

any way support the stand of the respondents nor

does it cause any prejudice to the petitioners.        The

petitioners have not relied upon the statement of

objections   filed   by   the    advocates'    Association,

Bangalore, in support of their case; they stand on

their own contentions and submissions.         We do not

think that the petitioners in any way sought reliance

on the stand taken by the advocates' Association,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">                           -: 120 :-</span>

no opinion in the matter.

<p id="p_194">
</p><p id="p_195">      84.   We also hold that no specific direction can be

issued for framing of fresh Norms, Rules or Regulations

under <a href="/doc/190479120/" id="a_70">Section 16(2)</a> of the Act. That is a matter left to the

administrative decision of the Hon'ble Chief Justice and the

Hon'ble Judges of the High Court. We specifically hold so,

in view of our answer given to Point Nos.1 supra.           <a href="/doc/1521969/" id="a_71">In

M/s.Narinder     Chand    Hem         Raj   and   others   vs.

[1971 (2) SC 747] it has been categorically held that no

Court can issue a mandate to a Legislature to enact a

particular law. Similarly, no Court can direct a subordinate

legislative body to enact or not to enact a law which it may

be competent to enact. In this context, reliance could be

placed on <a href="/doc/50294192/" id="a_72">A.K.Roy vs. Union of India</a> [(1982) 1 SCC

senior advocates is hence, declined. Liberty is reserved to

the Hon'ble Chief Justice and Judges of this Court to take a

<p id="p_196">
</p><p id="p_197">      85.   Before   parting,    we   observe     that   the

designation of respondent - advocates as senior advocates,

which have been impugned in these writ petitions have not

been interfered with and remain intact.         This verdict

however, does not imply any judicial certification to the

respondent - advocates, who have been designated as

senior advocates about their future calibre. Ultimately, it

is the Bar, which is the Judge of senior advocates, as it is

the Judge of Judges, to form an opinion about the

respondent - advocates.      The passage of time would

ultimately judge the respondent - advocates.       It is our

fond hope that the respondent - advocates, who have

been designated as senior advocates would uphold the

high traditions and ethics to be followed by them, as also,

of the profession to the future generation of advocates,

who would enter the portals of this august Court and

various other Courts in the State. We also hope and trust

that by this decision, the rancor if any, in a section of the

Bar, is assuaged as a strong, unified Bar is essential for an

independent judiciary.
