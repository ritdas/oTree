JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON):

</p><p id="p_3">1.     By this common judgment, we shall dispose of the above nine

appeals as they arise out of similar facts and raise common legal

issues.    All the appellants are carrying on the business of stone


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  3</span>
 crushing under different names and styles in the State of Haryana.

All of them challenge the legality and correctness of the order

passed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (for short

'HSPCB') dated 15th March, 2012 which was upheld by the appellate

authority vide its order dated 24th January, 2013. Besides referring

to the specific facts in the cases, we would take up the Appeal No.

95 of 2013, (M/s. Jai Mata Di Stone Crushers vs. Haryana SPCB

and Anr.) as the lead case for reference of the facts. M/s. Jai Mata

Di Stone Crushers is a sole proprietorship concern, earlier working

under the name and style of M/s Tej Singh Stone Crushers. The

said appellant carries on the business of stone crushing, located in

district Yamuna Nagar of the State of Haryana and falls under the

jurisdiction of HSPCB.   When it started its business in the year

1996, the appellant had obtained a No Objection Certificate (for

short the 'NOC') from HSPCB on 9th September 1996. The NOC by

HSPCB was issued based on the report dated 20th August 1996 of

the Revenue authorities specifying that the appellant-unit is within

the siting parameters for stone crushing units. After incurring

heavy expenditure, it installed expensive equipment and got

installed anti-pollution control measures to satisfy the terms and

conditions of the consent granted under the Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (for short the 'Act of 1981').   The

appellant unit was granted consent from year to year by the

HSPCB.    The State Government of Haryana issued a notification

dated 18th December, 1997 containing certain guidelines for

installation and operation of stone crushers. With reference to the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>
 said guidelines, a survey/inspection of the various units was

conducted by the Regional officers of the HSPCB and reports were

prepared.    As per the report, Villages Ballewala, Doiwala and

Koliwala were submerged in floods in 1978.          According to the

appellant, thus, the guidelines were inconsequential. In response

to the query made by the HSPCB, vide its letter dated 25th August,

2003, the revenue authorities vide their letter dated 12th September,

2003 informed that the three villages had submerged and no abadi

was left. Consequently, for giving consent, the measurements were

being considered from Lal Dora of Village Devgarh in that area.


</p><p id="p_4">2.   Another notification dated 30th October, 1998 was issued by

the State Government where, inter alia, it intended to give benefit of

Schedule II entry (n) to the stone crushers installed and in

operation for a continuous period of one year before the coming into

force of the notification of 1997. According to this appellant, they

never violated either of the notifications afore-stated, rather they

were entitled to the benefits of the notifications. No objection with

regard to the distance was ever raised and the appellant has been

granted consent till the year 2011.      The appellant-unit vide its

application dated 8th April, 2011 applied for obtaining of consent to

operate for a further period of two years (2011-12 and 2012-13). It

is pleaded by this appellant that in the year 2007, some villagers

filed frivolous suits against the stone crushers, including that of the

appellant. An application under order VII Rule 11 of the Code of

Civil Procedure, 1908 was filed by the appellant and the other

interested parties, which culminated into a withdrawal before the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   5</span>
 High Court. The appellant alleges that the application for obtaining

consent, of the Board was then pending before the Board. On 2nd

February, 2012, a show cause notice was issued by the HSPCB to

the stone crusher-unit including that of the appellant stating that

the units were running in violation to the provisions of the

notification dated 18th December, 1997 and the consent had been

granted to the appellant under a misconception of the facts,

projected by the revenue authorities. The said show cause notice

dated 2nd February, 2012 reads as under:

<p id="p_19">6.   The order of the HSPCB was challenged by the appellant by

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                10</span>
 filing an appeal before the appellate authority constituted under the

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_27">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the Act of

1981. The appellate authority, after hearing the parties and by a

detailed order dismissed the appeals vide its order dated 24th

January, 2013. The relevant part of the said order reads as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">     9. "The Census Department of Government of India, on the

     basis of Census carried out after every ten years publishes

     villagewise directory of the District which contains the list of

     all the villages as per Revenue record and updates the data in

     respect of population and other related parameters. The

     respondent Board has placed on record report which is

     annexed with copy of Memo No. 1637 dated 08.12.2011 from

     the District Statistical Officer, Yamuna Nagar, addressed to

     the Regional Officer, Yamuna Nagar with population Census

     for the years 1991 and 2001 in respect of villages Diowala (69)

     Bhood Majra (70) Kohliwala (68) and Ballamajra (71) with their

     population. The population of these villages as per 2011

     Census was 261, 541, 329 and 839. This population growth is

     significant over 1991 Census data. It is yet to be published for

     the Census conducted for 2011, as informed by the District

     Statistical Officer, Yamuna Nagar. Thus it is authenticated

     that these villages existed in the year 1991 and it supported

     the view that even if these were washed away, these had since

     been rehabilitated earlier to 1991. So the existence of these

     villages cannot be questioned and the distance has to be

     measured from nearest village Abadi as per the requirements


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                 11</span>
 of Notification dated 18.12.1997. There is another document

titled "Report as on 2002 and Report as on today," prepared by

Patwaris of concerned villages, Kanungo and the Tehsildar of

Chhachhrauli as on 08.12.2011 in respect of five villages

namely (i) Diowala (ii) Ballawala (iii) Kohliwala (iv) Bhood Majra

and (v) Bhood Kalan, showing No. of houses in each village

and authenticating the existence of these villages in the year

2002. The report of the Distt. Forest Officer, Yamuna Nagar

records distance of the Units from the nearest Forest Land as

per Govt. record. The report does not mention the year of

recorded Forest. As the report does not record year so it does

not help us in reaching at any conclusion about the

applicability of the said parameter as far as the distance from

recorded Forest is concerned on the given date. So we do not

have any other view but to agree to the distance clearance of

Forest at the time of issue of NOC to the Unit. The respondent

Board has also placed on record report which is jointly signed

by Revenue Deptt. and the PWD Officers consisting of SDO

PWD B&amp;R and the Tehsildar and 3 other Officials. The

distance of the Unit of the appellants is much less than

required 1000 m. So, according to this report the Unit does

not meet the parameters of distance from the nearest village

Abadi   which   should    be    minimum    1000   mtrs   as   per

Notification. On the basis of overwhelming facts furnished by

SDO (c) Bilaspur, in his report addressed to the Deputy

Commissioner, Yamuna Nagar with a copy to the Regional


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                               12</span>
 Officer respondent No. 2, this Authority is inclined to accept

and agree to the truthfulness of the report about siting

distance from village abadi.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_20"> 10.   The Refusal Consent for the year 2011-12 vide letter

dated 15.03.2012 (Annex A-1) has listed following three issues

with regard to which the Unit has failed to comply :-


</p><p id="p_21">i)     Not submitting operation Schedule of the Stone Crusher.

</p><p id="p_22">ii)    Unit has not submitted analysis report under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_28">Air Act</a>,

       1981.
</p>
<p id="p_23">iii)   Not meeting the siting parameters as per Notification

       dated 18.12.1997.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
The appellants have contended that they had been granted

NOC in the year 1996 on the basis of distance parameters

based on reports of the Revenue Authorities and those of the

Forest Department about the distance from village Abadi and

the recorded Forest, respectively and the respondent now

cannot deny Consent after such a long period spanning over

15 years. We do not buy this argument as the NOC and

Consent granted on misconceived information cannot be

perpetuated as a matter of right. On the basis of documents /

reports and oral submissions during the arguments by the

respondent counsel we unhesitatingly accept the contention

that the Unit is failing in respect of distance parameter from

the nearest village abadi as per report dated 08.02.2011 of

SDO (c) Bilaspur, Distt. Yamuna Nagar. The Refusal of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                               13</span>
      Consent    vide   letter   No.    HSPCB/YMN/2011/5658       dated

     15.03.2012 (Annexure A/1) is upheld. The appeal fails and we

     order accordingly with no order as to costs."


</p><p id="p_25">7.   Except in Appeal No. 95 of 2013, all other appellants filed

review applications before the appellate authority praying for

variation/review of the order dated 24th January, 2013 vide which 8

appeals were disposed of.       In the review application, all possible

grounds were taken including that the judgment suffered from

errors apparent on the face of the record and also that the plea of

granting of benefit of Clause (n) of Schedule II to the Notification

dated 30th October, 1998 had not been considered appropriately by

the appellate authority.        This review application came to be

dismissed by order of the appellate authority dated 5th April, 2013.

In Appeal No. 95 of 2013 there is a challenge only to the order dated

24th January, 2013 and the appeal is barred by delay of 210 days

as per the averments of the applicant-appellant himself, for which a

separate application for condonation of delay bearing M.A. No.

878/2013 had been filed by the appellant.


</p><p id="p_26">8.   In all other appeals, though there is no challenge to the order

dated 5th April, 2013, but in the application for condonation of delay

by the appellants, they have referred to the filing of the Review

Application before the appellate tribunal and its dismissal vide

order dated 5th April, 2013. They have prayed for condonation of

delay which according to them is 49 days.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                      14</span>
</p><p id="p_27"> 9.   From the above narration of facts, it is clear that according the

HSPCB, the appellants, stone-crusher owners, had committed three

violations, namely:
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">(a) Non-submission of operation schedule of stone crushers;


</p><p id="p_30">(b) Non-submission of analysis report under the Act of 1981; and


</p><p id="p_31">(c) Not meeting the sitting parameters as per the notification dated

18th December, 1997. In the other show cause notice, it was stated

that the stone-crushers were violating the provisions of the

notification of 1997 and the HSPCB had granted consent under

misconception of the facts as narrated by the authorities, as the

above three villages had been rehabilitated.     The stone crushers

were running within the prohibited distance. The HSPCB had after

conducting inspection and survey had passed the order dated 15 th

March, 2012 declining grant of consent.      These findings of facts

were duly approved and concurred by the appellate authority in its

order dated 24th January, 2013.       The appellate authority, as is

evident from the above, referred to the relevant part of the order

dated 15th March, 2013 of the HSPCB, wherein paragraph 9, it had

examined the rehabilitation of the villages with reference to the

population thereof.   They also relied upon the report as on 2002

and report as on today prepared by the patwaris of the concerned

villages showing the number of houses in each village and

authenticating the existence of these villages in the year 2002.

These are findings of facts which were concurrently being recorded

by the Board and the appellate authority and are duly supported by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                 15</span>
 relevant and admissible records.       They have not taken into

consideration any irrelevant evidence or material.      Thus, there

would be no justification before the Tribunal to interfere with these

concurrent findings of facts. Human health is of utmost importance

and must prevail over a private business interest.      These stone

crushers give rise to substantial quantity of fine fugitive dust

emissions and high level of noise which create health hazards to the

workers as well as the surrounding population by way of causing

respiratory diseases and hearing impairment. The dust also

adversely affects visibility, reduces growth of vegetation and

hampers aesthetics of the area. A large body of literature based on

field research indicates that air pollution caused by the stone

crushing   industry   has   adverse   implications,   both   at   the

occupational level and community level. Air borne particles of free

Silica (SiO2) of sizes smaller than 10 microns are capable of

reaching respiratory system and cause silicosis, which in turn can

result in normal lung tissues being replaced by non-functioning

fibrous tissues (called fibrosis). There are also studies by National

Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH) Ahmedabad which point to

the high incidence of silicosis and tuberculosis among stone

cutters. Presence of stone crushers in the vicinity of villages can

therefore be a serious environmental and health hazard. Assuming

that these stone crushers were adhering to the parameters, which

as per the report of the HSPCB they are not, even then it is an

undisputed proposition that their cumulative effect would be




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                 16</span>
 injurious to the health of the villagers who are living within 400 or

800 meters of the location of these crushers.


</p><p id="p_32">10. Reference in this regard could be made to a recent judgment of

the Tribunal in the case of DRG Grade Udyog v. State of Madhya

Pradesh and Ors. All (I) NGT Reporter (Delhi) 205 where while

discussing the impact of stone crushers on the schools within the

close vicinity of the stone crushers, the Tribunal held as under:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">          "23. At this stage, we notice some of the adverse
          impacts of such activity, which have been
          scientifically analysed, in relation to air and noise
          pollution with specific reference to children.
          Children are prone to higher effects of air
          pollution than adults as they consume much
          larger quantity of air per unit body weight that
          exposes them to higher degree of air pollution.
          Max Kilber, as early as in 1932, invented the
          theory of "Inverse Size Matter Metabolic Rate Law".
          This theory supports what we have stated above.
          Thus, adverse environmental impacts of running
          of stone crushing units in the vicinity of a school
          cannot be ignored or ousted on the plea of it not
          being covered under as residential area.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_25">          24. Similarly, the noise generated by the stone
          crushers will adversely affect the concentration
          level of children. Such activity is likely to hamper
          their ultimate performance. Noise has a 'masking'
          effect.    Although     a    subdued       noise    is
          understandable in a quiet room, it is difficult to
          understand even a raised voice in noisy
          environment, like working of a stone crusher. This
          drowning or 'masking' occurs as a result of
          excitation of auditory nerve cells. In other words,
          it affects the understanding, concentration and
          capacity of the children to attentively listen to the
          lectures of their teachers. Persistent noise has
          long-term as well as short-term effects on health
          of children."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_33">11. The notification of 18th December, 1997 has spelt out the

protective measures and anti-pollution devices that a stone crusher

is required to take and instal. The stone crusher which had started


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                  17</span>
 its operations subsequent to the coming into force of the said

notification had to be located at a distance of more than one km.

from the nearest village abadi.              Vide the notification dated 30th

October, 1998, for the existing units, this distance was reduced to

400 metres of the village abadi/Lal Dora. This benefit was available

to the stone crushers which were in operation one year prior to the

issuance of the notification of 1997. The limits of distance

prescribed under these notifications were mandatory and not

preferential.    The notifications impose restriction on the power of

the competent authority to permit installation and operation of

stone crushers at a distance less than the prescribed distance. In

the present case, the stone crushers of the appellant cannot claim

the benefit of clause (n) of Schedule II of the notification of 1998 on

the ground that the villages had been wiped out in the floods. This

is for the reason that the concurrent finding had been returned in

this regard by the Board and the appellate authority against the

appellant. It has been held with reference to the concurrent reports

of the Tehsildar and the Forest Department, as referred to supra,

that a large number of houses were found existing at the sites even

in the year 1991. The notifications have to be interpreted in a

manner that it would advance the cause of environmental

protection rather than frustrate the same. The obvious result of

accepting       the   contention   of        the   appellant   would   cause

environmental damage. It is clear from the records before the

Tribunal that the units of the appellant are violating the condition




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                        18</span>
 of distance imposed under the notification of 1997, as amended by

the notification of 1998.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">12. In view of the facts of this case and the law aforestated, we do

not see any reason to interfere with the order dated 24 th January,

2013 under appeal in these cases.
</p>
<p id="p_36">Limitation:

<p id="p_37">13. Though we have dealt with and decided this case on merits, as

above, still there is another hurdle which the appellants are

required to cross as to all these appeals being barred by time. It is

the delay in terms of <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_29">Section 16</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act,

2010 (NGT Act). Section 16 of the NGT Act reads as under:-

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                 19</span>
<p id="p_38"> 14. The provisions of this Section came to be interpreted by a

Bench of this Tribunal which has stated the law beyond ambiguity

that once there is a delay beyond 90 days, then the Tribunal will

have no jurisdiction to condone the same unless and until the

communication of the order impugned in the appeal is shown not to

have been received so late that it falls beyond the period of 90 days.

This Tribunal had the occasion to deal with this aspect and

interpretation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_32">Section 16</a> of the Act.      Upon

discussing the case law at some length and examining the

legislative intent underlying this provision, the Tribunal in the case

of <a href="/doc/97059486/" id="a_33">Nikunj Developers &amp; Others v. the State of Maharashtra &amp; Others</a>

[2013 ALL(I) NGT(1) PB 40] held as under:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">          "19. From language of the above provision it is clear
          that the Tribunal loses jurisdiction to condone the
          delay if the delay is of more than 90 days. Every
          appeal has to be filed within 30 days from the date of
          communication of the order. That is, what an
          applicant is required to ensure before the appeal is
          heard on merits. However, the Tribunal has been
          vested with the jurisdiction to entertain the appeal
          which is filed after 30 days from the date of
          communication of an order. This power to condone
          the delay has a clear inbuilt limitation as it ceases to
          exist if the appeal is filed in excess of 60 days,
          beyond the prescribed period of limitation of 30 days
          from the date of communication of such order. To
          put it simply, once the period of 90 days lapses from
          the date of communication of the order, the Tribunal
          has no jurisdiction to condone the delay. The
          language of the provision is clear and explicit. It
          admits of no ambiguity and the legislative intent that
          Tribunal should not and cannot condone the delay in
          excess of 90 days in all, is clear from the plain
          language of the provision.</blockquote><p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">          20. As stated in the cases Hiralal Ratan Lal and
          India Houses (supra) the period of limitation
          statutorily prescribed, has to be strictly adhered to
          and cannot be relaxed and or departed from, on
          equitable consideration. Further, in construing a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                  20</span>
 statutory provision, the first and the foremost rule of
construction is that of literary construction. We do
not see any reason to expand the scope of the
provision and interpret the proviso to <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_34">Section 16</a> in
the manner that Tribunal can be vested with the
power of condoning the delay beyond 90 days. Such
interpretation would be contrary to the specific
language of the Section and would defeat the very
legislative intent and object behind this provision.

             concerned, the crucial words are "but
             not thereafter" used in the proviso to
             Sub-section (3). In our opinion, this
             phrase would amount to an express
             exclusion within the meaning of
             <a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_46">Section 29(2)</a> of the Limitation Act, and
             would therefore bar the application of
             <a href="/doc/279891/" id="a_47">Section 5</a> of that Act. Parliament did
             not need to go further. To hold that the
             court could entertain an application to
             set aside the award beyond the
             extended period under the proviso,
             would render the phrase "but not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                       21</span>
 thereafter" wholly otiose. No principle of
interpretation would justify such a
result.
</p>
<p id="p_44">16. Furthermore,       <a href="/doc/964919/" id="a_48">Section 34(1)</a> itself
provides that recourse to a court
against an arbitral award may be made
only by an application for setting aside
such award "in accordance with" Sub-
</p><p id="p_45">section (2) and Sub-section (3). Sub-
</p><p id="p_46">section (2) relates to grounds for setting
aside an award and is not relevant for
our purposes. But an application filed
beyond the period mentioned in
<a href="/doc/964919/" id="a_49">Section 34</a>, Sub-section (3) would not
be an application "in accordance with"
</p><p id="p_47">that Sub-section. Consequently by
virtue of <a href="/doc/964919/" id="a_50">Section 34(1)</a>, recourse to the
court against an arbitral award cannot
be made beyond the period prescribed.
</p><p id="p_48">The importance of the period fixed
under <a href="/doc/964919/" id="a_51">Section 34</a> is emphasised by the
provisions of <a href="/doc/201153/" id="a_52">Section 36</a> which provide
that

"where the time for making an
application to set aside the arbitral
award under <a href="/doc/964919/" id="a_53">Section 34</a> has expired ...
</p><p id="p_49">the award shall be enforced under the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in the
same manner as if it were a decree of
the court".
</p>
<p id="p_50">This is a significant departure from the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_54">Arbitration Act</a>, 1940.
Under the 1940 Act, after the time to
set aside the award expired, the court
was required to "proceed to pronounce
judgment according to the award, and
upon the judgment so pronounced a
decree shall follow" (<a href="/doc/1232641/" id="a_55">Section 17</a>). Now
the consequence of the time expiring
under <a href="/doc/964919/" id="a_56">Section 34</a> of the 1996 Act is
that the award becomes immediately
enforceable without any further act of
the court. If there were any residual
doubt on the interpretation of the
language used in <a href="/doc/964919/" id="a_57">Section 34</a>, the
scheme of the 1996 Act would resolve
the issue in favour of curtailment of the
court's powers by the exclusion of the

Act, 1944, which is pari materia to
<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_61">Section 125</a> of the Electricity Act and

</p><p id="p_52">  8. The Commissioner of Central Excise
  (Appeals) as also the Tribunal being
  creatures of statute are vested with
  jurisdiction to condone the delay beyond
  the permissible period provided under the
  statute. The period up to which the
  prayer for condonation can be accepted is
  statutorily provided. It was submitted
  that the logic of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_62">Section 5</a> of the
  Limitation Act, 1963 (in short "the
  <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_63">Limitation Act</a>") can be availed for
  condonation of delay. The first proviso to
  <a href="/doc/1543006/" id="a_64">Section 35</a> makes the position clear that
  the appeal has to be preferred within
  three    months     from    the    date    of
  communication to him of the decision or
  order. However, if the Commissioner is
  satisfied that the appellant was prevented
  by sufficient cause from presenting the
  appeal within the aforesaid period of 60
  days, he can allow it to be presented
  within a further period of 30 days. In
  other words, this clearly shows that the
  appeal has to be filed within 60 days but
  in terms of the proviso further 30 days'
  time can be granted by the appellate
  authority to entertain the appeal. The
  proviso     to     Sub-section      (1)    of
  <a href="/doc/1543006/" id="a_65">Section 35</a> makes the position crystal
  clear that the appellate authority has no
  power to allow the appeal to be presented
  beyond the period of 30 days. The
  language used makes the position clear
  that the legislature intended the appellate
  authority to entertain the appeal by
  condoning delay only up to 30 days after
  the expiry of 60 days which is the normal
  period for preferring appeal. Therefore,
  there is complete exclusion of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_66">Section 5</a> of
  the Limitation Act. The Commissioner
  and the High Court were therefore
  justified in holding that there was no
  power to condone the delay after the

              the Act which provides for appeals
              and revisions to various authorities.
              Though Parliament has specifically
              provided an additional period of 30
              days in the case of appeal to the
              Commissioner, it is silent about the
              number of days if there is sufficient
              cause in the case of an appeal to the
              Appellate Tribunal. Also an additional
              period of 90 days in the case of
              revision by the Central Government
              has been provided. However, in the

preliminary limitation period for preferring

condoning the delay by showing sufficient
cause after the prescribed period, there is
complete exclusion of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_80">Section 5</a> of the

</p><p id="p_60">35. It was contended before us that the
words "expressly excluded" would mean
that there must be an express reference
made in the special or local law to the
specific provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_81">Limitation Act</a> of
which the operation is to be excluded. In
this regard, we have to see the scheme of
the special law which here in this case is
the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_82">Central Excise Act</a>. The nature of the
remedy provided therein is such that the
legislature intended it to be a complete
code by itself which alone should govern
the several matters provided by it. If, on
an examination of the relevant provisions,
it is clear that the provisions of the
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_83">Limitation Act</a> are necessarily excluded,
then the benefits conferred therein
cannot be called in aid to supplement the
provisions of the Act. In our considered
view, that even in a case where the
special law does not exclude the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_84">Sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/769768/" id="a_85">24</a> of the
Limitation Act by an express reference, it
would nonetheless be open to the court to
examine whether and to what extent, the
nature of those provisions or the nature
of the subject-matter and scheme of the
special law exclude their operation. In
other words, the applicability of the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_86">Limitation Act</a>, therefore,
is to be judged not from the terms of the
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_87">Limitation Act</a> but by the provisions of
the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_88">Central Excise Act</a> relating to filing of

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">         "(c) Use of negative words
          Another mode of showing a clear intention
         that the provision enacted is mandatory, is
         by clothing the command in a negative
         form.     As    stated    by    CRAWFORD:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">         "Prohibitive or negative words can rarely, if
         ever, be directory. And this is so even
         though the statute provides no penalty for
         disobedience." As observed by SUBBARAO,
         J.: "Negative words are clearly prohibitory
         and are ordinarily used as a legislative
         device to make a statute imperative".
         <a href="/doc/1020287/" id="a_98">Section 80</a> and Section 87-B of the Code of

         Act, 1965 (as amended in 1993) and
         similar other provisions have therefore,
         been construed as mandatory. A provision
         requiring 'not less than three months'
         notice' is also for the same reason
         mandatory.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_38">         But the principle is not without exception.
         Section 256 of the Government of India,
         1953, was construed by the Federal Court
         as directory though worded in the negative
         form. Directions related to solemnization of
         marriages though using negative words
         have been construed as directory in cases
         where the enactments in question did not
         provide for the consequence that the
         marriage in breach of those directions
         shall be invalid. Considerations of general
         inconvenience, which would have resulted
         in holding these enactments mandatory,
         appear to have outweighed the effect of the
         negative words in reaching the conclusion
         that they were in their true meaning
         merely director. An interesting example,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                     27</span>
                     where negative words have been held to be
                    directory, is furnished in the construction
                    of section 25-F of the Industrial Dispute
                    Act, 1947, where compliance of clause (c)
                    has been held to be directory; although
                    compliance of clauses (a) and (b) which are
                    connected by the same negative words is
                    understood as mandatory. These cases
                    illustrate that the rule, that negative words
                    are usually mandatory, is like any other
                    rule subordinate to the context, and the
                    object intended to be achieved by the
                    particular requirement."

<blockquote id="blockquote_39">          26. The provision of Section 16 of the NGT Act are
          somewhat similar to <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_107">Section 34</a> of Arbitration and
          <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_108">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996. Thus, adopting an analogous
          reasoning, as was adopted in Chhattisgarh State
          Electricity Board (supra), we would have no hesitation
          in coming to the conclusion that we have no
          jurisdiction to condone the delay when the same is in
          excess of 90 days from the date of communication of
          the order to any person aggrieved."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_68">15. Now, we may apply the above principle to the facts of the

present case. As far as the Appeal No. 95/2013 is concerned, the

impugned order was passed on 24th January, 2013 and the same

was received by the appellant. In the application for condonation of

delay, the appellant has not stated as to when the appellant

received the said order.     Presumably, the order was received

immediately thereafter.   The appeal ought to have been filed within

30 days of the communication of the order or at best within 90 days

upon showing sufficient cause for the condonable delay of 60 days.

Beyond this period of 90 days, the Tribunal would not be able to

condone the delay even upon showing existence of sufficient cause.

As per the appellant, he prays for condonation of 210 days' delay

though, in the present case, the order is of 24th January, 2013 and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                 28</span>
 the appeal was filed on 3rd October, 2013. Even if the period of 90

days is excluded, still there would be a delay of eight months and

17 days.   After excluding the permissible period of 90 days, the

appeal would still be barred by more than six months, which the

Tribunal has no jurisdiction to condone.     Thus, the appeal is liable

to be dismissed on the grounds of limitation alone which we do

hereby dismiss.
</p>
<p id="p_69">16. In all other cases, the order of the HSPCB of 15th March, 2012

and that of the appellate authority is of 24th January, 2013. All the

appellants had filed review application before the appellate

authority which came to be dismissed vide order dated 5 th April,

2013.   In the appeals, none of the appellants have challenged

specifically the order of review dated 5th April, 2013.


</p><p id="p_70">17. It is a settled proposition of law that where a review

application is dismissed and the original order, review of which is

sought, is maintained, the limitation will be computed with

reference to the first order, i.e. 24th January, 2013. There being no

challenge to the order dated 5th April, 2013, all these appeals would

also be barred by eight months and the Tribunal will have no

jurisdiction to condone the delay. All these appeals have been filed

much beyond the period of 90 days, the prescribed period and

permissible period of limitation beyond which the Tribunal has no

jurisdiction to condone the delay. As such all these appeals are also

liable to be dismissed on the grounds of limitation.

</p><p id="p_71"> 18. In view of our detailed discussion above, we dismiss all these

appeals. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, we

leave the parties to bear their own costs.
