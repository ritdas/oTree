<a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_23">33</a> A of the Act was framed against the accused Mahesh Kumar. It is
a matter of record that it is a warrant trial case and charge should

not appear and he was declared PO during the proceedings. It is

</p>

<p id="p_11">8.      In post-charge evidence, complainant has examined only one
witness i.e      Dr. B.M.S. Reddy, Sr. Environmental Engineer, DPCC.
This witness has adopted the same examination-in-chief which was
recorded in pre-charge evidence. Accused has also adopted the
same      cross-examination     which    was    recorded   in   pre-charge
evidence. Thereafter, post-charge evidence was closed.
</p>

<p id="p_12">9.      Statement of accused was recorded. In his statement accused
denied all the allegations and stated that he has been falsely
implicated in this case. However, accused opted not to lead any
defence evidence.

<p id="p_13">10.     I have given my thoughtful consideration to the submissions

<p id="p_15">12.       Complainant has to prove that accused being the Proprietor
of M/s. Sonia Leather was found engaged in Wet Blue Tanning (H-
category unit), a water polluting activity, without obtaining consent
from the concerned department and there was no effluent
treatment plant to treat waste water and by discharging the
untreated effluent from the said unit into a drain / sewer caused
pollution and thereby contravened the provision of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_41">Water Act</a>. To
support its case, complainant has examined only one witness. This
witness has specifically deposed that on 17.07.1998, Sh. P.S. Pankaj,
the then AEE visited the premises bearing no. 52/24, Nihal Vihar,
Nangloi and found that accused was occupier of the premises in
question and was having the control over the affairs of M/s. Sonia
Leathers and was found engaged in the activity of Wet Blue Tanning

CC no. 537988/2016           DPCC Vs. Mahesh Kumar                   Page 6 of 8
 and discharging trade effluent without any treatment facility as well
as the consent from the DPCC. This witness has further deposed
that Sh. P.S. Pankaj prepared the inspection report and said report
has been duly proved as CW-1/4. This witness has identified the
signature of Sh. P.S. Pankaj being worked with him. This witness has
specifically deposed that an inspection of the unit was again carried
out by him on 16.09.1998 and found that unit was in operation
despite the directions issued by DPCC vide Ex. CW-1/5 and said
inspection report is Ex. CW-1/7. This witness has further deposed
the accused unit was found to be operating without requisite
Pollution Control System as well as the consent from DPCC and
accordingly, accused has violated the provision of <a href="/doc/292346/" id="a_42">Section 24</a>/<a href="/doc/1046852/" id="a_43">25</a>/<a href="/doc/743481/" id="a_44">26</a>
&amp; <a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_45">33</a> (A) of the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_16">13.       This witness was cross-examined by the accused. Only
suggestion was given in the cross-examination that unit was closed
in the year 1998. Except suggestions, nothing important was put to
the witness to impeach his credibility. Even otherwise, cross-
examination of witness shows that accused is not disputing about
the inspections carried out by the complainant. The only plea taken
by the accused is that he has closed the unit. As per cross-
examination of CW-1, complainant department visited the premises
in question in the year 2007 and at that time, unit was not
operating. A suggestion was also given that unit was closed in the
month of December 1998. Hence, by mere closing the unit, it
cannot be said that the accused has not committed any offence.
Accused has nowhere denied that no inspections were carried out or
accused was not running any unit as claimed by the complainant.
Hence, I do not find any reason to disbelieve the statement of
witness. CW-1 has duly supported the case of the complainant.
