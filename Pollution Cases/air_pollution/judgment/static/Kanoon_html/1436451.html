</p><p id="p_20">18.  The orders impugned in all the seventeen writ petitions are identical  in
all  respects  and the Anna University has declined to grant fresh affiliation
for the year 2002-03 as the  respective  petitioners  have  not  produced  the
permission  prescribed  by  under  Section 37 B of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Fixation of ceiling on land) Act, 1961, besides for non-production of various
other certificates prescribed in the application for affiliation.  It is  also
brought  to  the  notice  of the Court that few of the petitioner institutions
claim minority status since they have been  established  either  by  religious
minority or by linguistic minority.
</p><p id="p_21">19.   The  counsel  for Anna University, the first respondent, filed a counter
statement that the petitioner in each of the writ petition failed  to  produce
the  permission  as  prescribed by Section 37 B of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms
(Fixation of ceiling on <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_2">Land) Act</a>, 1961, besides non-production of one or more
of the other certificates listed in serial numbers 10 to 17 of the application
form or lack of infrastructural facilities and, hence, the affiliation has not
been  granted  for  non-compliance  of  the  requirements  prescribed  by  the
University.  A counter affidavit has been filed by the Anna University in some
of  the  writ petitions and on behalf of Anna University a memo has been filed
adopting the same in all the other writ petitions.
</p><p id="p_22">20.  At the time of  hearing  it  was  represented  by  the  counsel  for  the
petitioners  in  each  of  the writ petitions that all requirements except the
permission under Section 37 B of the Land Reforms Act have been complied with,
while Mr.Masilamani, learned senior  counsel  appearing  for  Anna  University
represented  that  all  other  requirements  might  have been complied with or
capable of being complied with, but consideration of application, if  at  all,
is  subject  to  production  of permission by the respective petitioners under
Section 37 B of the Land Reforms Act or exemption notification under the  said
Act.   Entire  arguments  or  thrust  of the arguments advanced by either side
relates to the prior permission required  under  Section  37  B  of  the  Land
Reforms Act by the State Government for acquisition of the lands.
</p><p id="p_23">21.   In respect of other certificates, on behalf of few of the petitioners it
was represented that some District authorities have granted such certificates,
in some other Districts, authorities, namely,  Electrical  Inspector/Factories
Inspector,  etc., have declined to issue such certificates on the view that in
respect of educational institutions they are not competent to  issue  required
certificates.
</p><p id="p_24">22.   Mr.Masilamani,  learned  senior  counsel  represented that in respect of
these  authorities,  the  State  Government  would  be   issuing   appropriate
directions  and,  therefore,  there may not be any problem for the petitioners
producing these certificates as formal directions have to  be  issued  by  the
State Government.    Counsel  in  each  of  the writ petition represented that
almost all the certificates prescribed by  the  University  have  either  been
produced.  Mr.Masilamani, learned senior counsel appearing for Anna University
had  taken the stand and it may be not necessary for this Court to consider or
examine as to production or non-production  of  certificates  other  than  the
permission under Section 37-B of the Land Reforms Act, 1961.
</p><p id="p_25">23.   The  learned  senior counsel appearing for the petitioner in each of the
writ petition as well as Mr.Masilamani, learned senior counsel  appearing  for
Anna  University  and  Mr.N.R.Chandran, learned Advocate General appearing for
the State advanced contentions in respect of the requirement, viz., production
of permission from the State Government under Section 37 B of The Land Reforms
(Fixation of ceiling on <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_3">Land) Act</a>, 1961.
</p><p id="p_26">24.  It is submitted by either side that no objection has been raised nor such
permission has been insisted by the All India Council for Technical  Education
thus  far  and  when  it granted approval in consultation with the affiliating
University and based on the recommendation of the inspection committee as well
as the  State  Government.    The  AICTE  accorded  approval  to  the  college
established  by  the respective petitioner for the academic year 2002-2003 for
various branches of engineering, subject to the condition that admission shall
be made through the central counselling by the Government of  Tamil  Nadu  and
subject  to  the general conditions as well as the norms and conditions of the
All India Council for Technical Education.  After securing the approval of the
AICTE, the respective petitioner approached Anna University for affiliation by
submitting application in the Form prescribed.    It  is  submitted  that  the
Expert  Committee  not  only  from the AICTE but also from the Anna University
inspected the respective colleges and submitted their report.  It  is  claimed
by   the  petitioners  that  both  Committees  reported  the  availability  of
prescribed infrastructures for establishing Engineering College.
</p><p id="p_27">25.  It is admitted that Anna University has not  framed  any  Regulations  or
Rules  prescribing  the  requirements  for grant of affiliation of engineering
courses for affiliation  of  new  colleges.    Mr.Masilamani,  learned  senior
counsel  stated  that  no  rule  or  regulation has been framed so far in this
respect, but the academic council/Vice Chancellor has prepared a format, which
requires production of various certificates  including  the  permission  under
Section 37 B of the Land Reforms Act.
</p><p id="p_28">26.   It  is  also brought to the notice of the Court by the counsel on either
side that the petitioners have challenged the validity of proviso to <a href="/doc/66420479/" id="a_4">Section 5</a>
(ac) introduced by The Anna University Amendment Act, 2001 and a batch of writ
petitions filed by each of the writ petitioner are pending.  Pending the  writ
petition/writ appeal,  the  operation of the said proviso has been stayed.  It
is further admitted by  either  side  that  the  Honourable  First  Bench  has
directed the State Government to consider the petitioners request for grant of
permission  under  Section 37 B of The Land Reforms Act within a time schedule
and orders are yet to be passed by the State.
</p><p id="p_29">27.  In these  batch  of  writ  petitions,  the  following  points  arise  for
consideration :-
</p><p id="p_30">"A)  Whether  the  denial  of affiliation by the impugned order passed by Anna
University to the  petitioner  in  each  of  the  writ  petition  is  illegal,
arbitrary, discriminatory and liable to be quashed ?
</p><p id="p_31">B)  Whether  Anna University acted illegally and in excess of its authority in
insisting as if it is a requirement for grant of affiliation under  University
laws for production of following permission / certificates :-
"(i) Prior permission under Section 37-B of The Land Reforms Act ;
</p><p id="p_32">(ii) Electrical Inspectors Certificate as prescribed by <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_5">Indian Electricity Act</a>
;
</p><p id="p_33">(iii)  Certificate issued by Inspector of Factories under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_6">Factories Act</a> in
respect of petitioner Engineering College ;
</p><p id="p_34">(iv) Structural soundness certificate issued by PWD Superintending Engineer ;
</p><p id="p_35">(v) Certificate from Pollution Control Authority."
</p><p id="p_36">C) Whether <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_7">Section 37-B</a> could be invoked at all by the petitioner Trusts after
having acquired the land without prior permission as mandated ?  If  so,  what
is the fate or effect of such acquisition without prior permission ?
D)  Whether  the  denial of affiliation by Anna University is vitiated by mala
fides ?
</p><p id="p_37">E) To what relief, if any, the petitioner in each  of  the  writ  petition  is
entitled to ?"
</p><p id="p_38">All the points could be considered together as they are interrelated.
</p><p id="p_39">28.   Section  37  B  of  The  Land  Reforms Act provides, if any public trust
created before 1.3.1972 desires to hold or acquire any land in excess  of  the
ceiling  or  for  the  purpose  of and in the case of any public trust created
after 1.3.1972 if such public trust desires to hold or acquire  any  land  for
the  purpose  of  establishing  any  educational  institution  or  hospital or
expanding any existing educational institution, it shall make  an  application
to the  Government  for  permission  to  hold  or  acquire  such  land.   Such
application shall  be  in  writing  and  shall  contain  such  particulars  as
prescribed.   Educational institutions means any college including engineering
college or medical college or agricultural or veterinary college or any school
or equivalent institution or any polytechnic.
</p><p id="p_40">29.  Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_8">Section 37</a> B provides that while granting or  refusing
permission,  the  Government  shall  take  into  consideration the purpose and
objects of the public trust; whether the land is required  for  the  immediate
use or  use  in  future and such other particulars as may be prescribed.  Such
permission could be granted subject to <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_9">Section 73</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_41">30.  It is pointed out by the  learned  Advocate  General  that  in  terms  of
<a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_10">Section 37</a>  B prior permission alone is contemplated.  A reading of <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_11">Section 37</a>
B makes it clear that before acquisition such permission has to be secured  by
the public  trust.   In other words, only after securing the permission of the
Government, lands could be acquired by a public trust even for the purpose  of
an educational institution.
</p><p id="p_42">31.   <a href="/doc/875642/" id="a_12">Section  5</a> (1) (c) prescribes the ceiling or in the case of institutions
mentioned in column (1)  of  the  table  and  in  existence  on  the  date  of
commencement of  the  Act.    <a href="/doc/875642/" id="a_13">Section  5</a> (1)(c) has no application to a public
trust, which was not in existence on the date  of  commencement  of  the  Act.
<a href="/doc/875642/" id="a_14">Section  5</a>  (1)(c)(ii)  provides  that  any  trust holding land on the date of
commencement of the land less than the extent specified  in  the  table  shall
acquire  by no means whatsoever after that date any lands in excess of land so
held.
</p><p id="p_43">32.  According to Section 5 of The Land Reforms Act, Public Trust  holding  no
lands  at all on the date of commencement of the Act shall acquire by no means
whatsoever any land after the date of commencement of Act.  In other words,  a
public  trust, which has been constituted after the commencement of the Act is
prohibited  from  acquiring  any  land  by  any  means  whatsoever  after  the
commencement of the Act except with prior permission under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_15">Section 37</a> B.
</p><p id="p_44">33.   The petitioner in each of the writ petition is admittedly a public trust
constituted recently and long after the commencement of the Land Reforms  Act,
1961,  and  in  terms  of  <a href="/doc/875642/" id="a_16">Section 5</a> is prohibited from acquiring land for the
purpose of Engineering college established by it except with prior  permission
under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_17">Section 37</a> B.
</p><p id="p_45">34.   <a href="/doc/875642/" id="a_18">Section 5</a> (d)(ii) further mandates that any public trust of a charitable
nature holding land on the date of commencement of the  Act  lands  less  than
five  standard acres shall acquire by any means whatsoever after that date any
land in excess of the land so held and holding any land at all on the date  of
the  commencement of this Act shall acquire by any means whatsoever after that
date any land.  Thus there is a total embargo or  prohibition  of  any  public
trust acquiring  land  after  the commencement of the Act.  In other words, no
public trust existing on the date of commencement of the Act or constituted at
any time thereafter shall acquire lands after the commencement of the Act  any
lands  even  for  the  purpose of establishing a charitable institution or for
establishing an educational institution.  Even those public trusts  which  are
holding  lands less than the extent prescribed in the table on the date of the
commencement of the Act also cannot  acquire  any  lands.    The  clauses  and
provisos of Section 5 of The Land Reforms Act are mandatory.
</p><p id="p_46">35.   Therefore, it is pointed out by the learned senior counsel appearing for
the University as well as by the learned Advocate General that the  petitioner
trust  in  each of the writ petition is prohibited from acquiring any land for
the purpose of establishing an educational institution and they could not have
validly acquired land for establishing an  institution  except  after  getting
prior approval  before  the  acquisition  under  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_19">Section  37</a> B.  It is rightly
pointed out that the said provision is mandatory, as in terms of <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_20">Section  20-A</a>
acquisition   of   any  land  made  in  contravention  of  the  provisions  of
sub-sections (ii) (a) (b) or (d) (i) (ii) of <a href="/doc/875642/" id="a_21">Section 5</a> shall be null and  void
and  any  land which is so acquired shall as a penalty for such contravention,
be deemed to have been transferred to the Government with effect from the date
of such acquisition on a declaration by the authorised  officer  within  whose
jurisdiction such land or the major part thereof situate.
</p><p id="p_47">36.   It is pointed out that acquisition of the land by the petitioner in each
of the writ petition for the purpose of establishing an engineering college is
legally invalid and it is deemed to have been transferred  to  the  Government
from the  date  of  transfer  and not a valid or legal acquisition at all.  In
other words, it is rightly contended that  the  petitioner  trust  is  not  in
possession  of any land, much less, lawfully so as to enable it to establish a
college or an educational institution and, therefore,  the  petitioner  cannot
compel the  respondent-University  to  grant  affiliation.    According to the
learned senior counsel, the provisions of <a href="/doc/875642/" id="a_22">Section  5</a>  being  mandatory,  there
could  be  no  acquisition  at  all in the eye of law by the petitioner public
trust without a prior permission under Section 37 B of the Act.  If  any  land
is  acquired  in  contravention, the acquisition is null and void and any land
which is so  acquired  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  transferred  to  the
Government with effect from the date of such acquisition.
</p><p id="p_48">37.   It  is  pointed  out  by  the learned counsel appearing for for the writ
petitioners that till date no action or notice whatsoever has been  issued  by
the  authorised  officer under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_23">Section 21-A</a>, yet the petitioner have moved the
State Government for  necessary  permission  under  <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_24">Section  37</a>  B  after  the
acquisition of  the  land.  It is further pointed out that the AICTE which has
granted permission has not raised such an objection nor the  State  Government
which  has  issued  no objection certificate has raised such an objection and,
therefore, such  objection  cannot  be  raised  by  Anna  University.      The
regulations  of  the  Anna  University also do not prescribe for production of
permission in respect of the holding of the land by the petitioner trust  and,
therefore,  the  University  cannot  insist  for  the  production  of  such  a
permission under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_25">Section 37</a>  B  since  it  is  beyond  the  authority  of  the
respondent University.    This  contention  cannot be countenanced and it is a
misconception of the Land Reforms Act.  Unless the  petitioner  trust  legally
holds and is in occupation of prescribed extent of land, the petitioner is not
at  all  eligible  for  grant  of  affiliation as it would amount to not being
possessed of the requisite infrastructure.
</p><p id="p_49">38.  Another extreme contention being that having not stipulated production of
such a permission, it is too late for Anna University to insist for production
of permission under  <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_26">Section  37</a>  B  as  the  University  is  bound  to  grant
affiliation  when  once the petitioner satisfies the requirement prescribed by
the University in respect of academic matters alone and the  University  shall
not insist for permission or other certificates, which are not contemplated or
provided  for or stipulated by the statutory provisions of the Anna University
Act or the regulations framed thereunder.  It is to be pointed out  that  when
the petitioners are not holding lands legallly nor in possession of the lands,
much  less validly, and acquisition being in contravention of <a href="/doc/875642/" id="a_27">Section 5</a>, being
null and void, it is not open to  the  petitioner  to  contend  that  no  such
permission could be insisted at all by the University.
</p><p id="p_50">39.   It is true that the Anna University Act or regulation do not provide for
or contemplate production of such certificate or permission.   The  University
after  considering  the  application for affiliation could very well call upon
the petitioner in each of the writ petition to produce few of the certificates
or no objection  certificates  or  permission  including  a  permission  under
<a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_28">Section  37</a>  B  and  it  is  well  open  to  the  University to insist for the
production of permission without which the petitioner Trust cannot claim to be
a legal owner in lawful possession.
</p><p id="p_51">40.  It is contended by the counsel for the petitioner that the University  is
not  an  authority  to enforce the provisions of The Land Reforms (Fixation of
Ceiling on <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_29">Land) Act</a>, 1961 and, therefore, the University  cannot  insist  for
production  of  a  permission  under  <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_30">Section  37</a>  B  nor the University could
exercise the powers as an Authorised officer under the Land  Reforms  Act  and
action,  if any, in this respect has to be initiated by the Authorised officer
having jurisdiction and till then the petitioners title and possession  cannot
be disputed.
</p><p id="p_52">41.   This  contention  advanced  by  the  counsel  for  the petitioner though
attractive overlooks the fact that  acquisition  without  a  prior  permission
under  <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_31">Section  37</a>  B  by a public trust is prohibited and such acquisition is
invalid and, therefore, the very possession of land and buildings are doubtful
and the very corpus or foundation of the college being established falls  like
a house  of  cards.    It may that a formal declaration has to be issued under
<a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_32">Section 37</a> B by the Authorised officer which is a formality as the acquisition
by the petitioners is in violation of the Act.  The legal  effect  of  <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_33">Section
20-A</a>  is obvious as the acquisition of any land which is so acquired shall, as
a penalty, is deemed to have been transferred to the  Government  with  effect
from the  date  of such acquisition.  What remains to be done is a declaration
by the Authorised officer and he has to follow the simple procedure prescribed
<a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_34">Section 20-A</a>.
</p><p id="p_53">42.  The mandatory provision, which prohibits  acquisition,  such  acquisition
being  in  violation of statutory provision and the consequence being that the
land so acquired shall stand transferred to the State Government as a  penalty
would  show  that the acquisition by the petitioner Trust cannot be considered
to be a valid acquisition or legal acquisition for the purpose of establishing
an educational  institution.    In  terms  of  the  provisions  of  the  AICTE
Regulations,  the  petitioner,  a  public  trust  has  to  own and possess the
required extent of land and such possession or holding should be lawful.   For
the  purpose  of  establishing  an  educational  institution or a professional
college, it is also essential that it should be by a public trust in terms  of
the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court as well as the provisions of the
AICTE Act and the Regulations framed therein.
</p><p id="p_54">43.   It  is  admitted  that  the  petitioner has established the college with
necessary infrastructure and admissions have also been made through the single
window system for various branches of engineering and the  petitioner  college
has started  the  course.    But  for  the affiliation, all formalities, it is
asserted by the petitioners, have been complied with and affiliation  being  a
formality,  which  is  required  to be granted by the University when once the
petitioner satisfies the requirements prescribed by the AICTE as well  as  the
University  authorities, it is contended that the respondent University cannot
insist for production of a permission under Section 37 B of The Land Reforms (
Fixation of Ceiling on <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_35">Land) Act</a>.  It  is  also  contended  that  neither  the
University could refuse affiliation after the grant of approval by the AICTE.
</p><p id="p_55">44.   It is pointed out that AICTE which has granted approval has not examined
the effect of the provisions of the Land Reforms Act before according approval
for establishment of the engineering college to the petitioner trust.  In this
respect, Mr.Vijay Narayan, learned counsel appearing for AICTE  fairly  stated
that  all  these  days  the  attention  of the AICTE has not been drawn to the
provisions of The Land Reforms Act and AICTE had not examined the  implication
of  the  Land Reforms Act on the application for approval and hitherto all the
approvals/ permissions for the establishment of professional college has  been
granted without reference to The Land Reforms Act.
</p><p id="p_56">45.   It  is further submitted that AICTE has proceeded on the assumption that
acquisition of the land and holding of the land by all the trusts who  propose
to  establish  a professional colleges is valid and it is not violative of the
statutory provisions of The Land Reforms Act and only on that premise approval
has been granted.  Mr.Vijay Narayan states that hereafterwards AICTE will give
appropriate instructions  or  take  action  in  this  respect  to  avoid  such
contingency.   The  stand  of  the  AICTE is it has overlooked this aspect and
hereafterwards it shall insist for the production of necessary  permission  or
such other compliance as may be required by State enactments as well.
</p><p id="p_57">46.   One  another  argument  that has been advanced is that the provisions of
AICTE Act will override  the  provisions  of  the  Land  Reforms  Act.    This
contention just  deserves  to  be  mentioned  for being rejected.  There is no
merit in this contention as  the  two  enactments  operate  in  two  different
entries, fields and enacted by the competent legislature and it is not correct
to  contend  that  the  provisions  of the Land Reforms Act stands repealed or
excluded from its operation  by  the  provisions  of  the  AICTE  Act  or  the
Rules/Regulations framed  thereunder.    The validity of the provisions of the
Land Reforms Act has been upheld and in fact  it  is  included  in  the  Ninth
Schedule to  the Constitution as entry 274 to 277.  The provisions of The Land
Reforms Act has also received the assent  of  the  President.    There  is  no
conflict between  the two enactments.  On the other hand, the Land Reforms Act
regulates possession or holding of the land, while  AICTE  Act  regulates  the
establishment  of  a  professional  course  or  college  or  standards of such
education, etc., as the case may be.  Hence, this contention  deserves  to  be
rejected.
</p><p id="p_58">47.  Mr.    PL.Narayanan,  learned  counsel  appearing  for  one  of  the writ
petitioners contended that the  demand  for  production  of  permission  under
<a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_36">Section  37</a>  B is neither called for nor provided for by the provisions of the
Anna  University  Act  or  the  regulations  nor  even  the  so  called   Vice
Chancellor's proceedings  has  prescribed it in the format.  The insistence of
production of  certificate  being  beyond  the  authority  and  power,  it  is
contended  that  such  a  demand is illegal and, therefore, mandamus has to be
issued as prayed for.  This contention, though persuasive, but this Court will
not be justified in ignoring the mandatory provisions of The Land Reforms  Act
as no permission could be granted retrospectively by the State nor there could
be a  post  facto  permission  or approval.  Further, the land as and when the
Authorised officer issues a final declaration, it stands transferred from  the
date of  the  very  acquisition by the petitioner trust.  The very acquisition
will obviously confer no legal title or right.  This definitely  disables  the
petitioner  college from being in possession of holding or legal possession of
the land.  Legal ownership and  lawful  possession  alone  would  satisfy  the
requirements  of  the  AICTE  Regulations  as  well  as  provisons of the Anna
University, since without land and buildings there could be  no  establishment
of the  institution.    Without  a  valid  permission  under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_37">Section 37</a> B, the
petitioner cannot claim that it is in legal possession or it  is  legally  the
owner  of  the extent of land as prescribed by the AICTE, which the petitioner
Public Trust has acquired after the commencement  of  The  Land  Reforms  Act,
1961.
</p><p id="p_59">48.   The  provisions  of  the  Land  Reforms  Act  being  mandatory  and  the
acquisition by the public trust for the purpose of establishing a  college  or
an educational institution is prohibited by the provisions of the Land Reforms
Act,  it  follows that without a permission the petitioner cannot even acquire
the land nor it could hold the land legally.  For the purpose of  establishing
and  running  a  professional  college  like engineering, the petitioner trust
should not only hold land, but also be in peaceful, exclusive  possession  and
enjoyment to  the  exclusion of others.  Legality of acquisition by the public
trust in terms  of  <a href="/doc/875642/" id="a_38">Section  5</a>  stares  at  the  very  acquisition  as  it  is
prohibited.   Admittedly  no permission has been secured under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_39">Section 37</a> B by
the petitioner.  Therefore, it cannot be contended  by  the  counsel  for  the
petitioner  that  the  petitioner  could establish and run the college without
complying with the requirements of The Land Reforms Act.
</p><p id="p_60">49.  It may be that Anna University has pointed out  the  requirements  to  be
complied  in  respect  of  the  Land  Reforms  Act like any other provision or
requirement.  It may be that such pointing out is belated, but on  that  score
this  Court  will not be justified in ignoring the legally formidable point as
it goes to the very root of the claim of possession or claim of  ownership  of
holding  of  the  entire  extent  of land by the public trust to establish the
college.  Without owning and being in lawful possession no Engineering College
could be established or run as this is the basic and  a  condition  precedent.
Admittedly  the  petitioner, a Public Trust has acquired land recently for the
purpose of establishing a college, but  without  securing  permission.    Such
acquisition  being  prohibited  and confers no legal title and possession, the
University is well founded in requiring production of permission under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_40">Section
37-B</a>, which is being regularly insisted in the interest of students for  whose
benefit the college is being established.  Eventually for non-compliance it is
the students who suffer and, hence, the University is well founded.
</p><p id="p_61">50.   It  is also fairly admitted by either side that substantial amounts have
been invested in putting up extensive constructions for establishing a college
and all the colleges are holding the requisite extent of the  building  either
by  way  of  classroom  or library or workshop or laboratory or administrative
office or Hostel or other infrastructure as has been prescribed by the  AICTE.
The committee of the AICTE has inspected and they have submitted a report that
the  petitioners'  colleges have already provided necessary infrastructure and
they are ready.  So  also  the  committee  appointed  by  the  University  has
reported  that  each  one  of  the petitioner has put up office constructions,
provided necessary infrastructure as per the provisions of AICTE  as  well  as
University's requirement  for  establishing  the  college.  Students have also
been  admitted  under  the  single  window  system  in  all   the   petitioner
institutions pursuant to certain interim directions issued by this Court.
</p><p id="p_62">51.   This  Court during the arguments addressed a question to all the counsel
as to whether each petitioner is willing to file  an  affidavit  that  in  the
event  of  the  State  declining  to  exempt  the  acquisition  of land and if
declaration is issued under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_41">Section 20-A</a> which  results  in  transfer  of  the
lands  from  the  date  of  very  acquisition  by  the petitioner to the State
Government as per the statutory  provision,  which  is  a  statutory  fiction,
whether they are willing to hand over the entire institution over to the State
Government  or  to the University or such other authority or body as the State
Government may indicate.
</p><p id="p_63">52.  This aspect of the matter was discussed in open court as  it  is  pointed
out  that  in  the  event  of  the exemption being declined, the future of the
students who have been admitted to the petitioner colleges will be in jeopardy
and the petitioners in each of the  writ  petitioner,  who  is  not  in  legal
possession  and  not  owning the land may suffer and from such contingency the
student community should be saved.  All the  petitioners  answered  the  query
negatively  to  the Court and made it clear that they are not inclined to hand
over the engineering college they have established  irrespective  of  students
being made  to  suffer.  This Court is unable to appreciate such a stand as it
is not as if it is a private trust, or a personal property, but it is a public
trust, which has established the college and it is a dedication for  a  public
purpose  to establish a college which is presumed to have been established for
the benefit of the society at large and the student community at large.    All
that  the  trustees  in  management  may  have to give up their right to be in
management of the trust or trust properties  or  management  of  the  college,
which the  trust  has established.  But it is the choice of the petitioner and
nobody could compel them.
</p><p id="p_64">53.  One another contention which was advanced being that the stand  taken  by
the  Anna University is mala fide, in that it is acting as a tool in the hands
of the State Government.  This allegation has been made in the affidavit.  But
on a consideration of the allegations, this  Court  holds  that  there  is  no
material  at  all  to  establish either malice or ill will on the part of Anna
University is concerned and there is no  material  to  substantiate  that  the
orders  impugned  is the result of malice or ill will as has been laid down in
STATE OF HARYANA VS.  RAJENDRA SAXENA reported in AIR 1972 SC 1004.  Mala fide
must be shown by cogent material on record.  It is equally well settled in all
cases to controvert every  part  of  allegations,  which  are  vague  and  not
specific.   Unless  the  allegations  of  mala  fide  or bias are specifically
pointed, it may not be necessary to controvert such vague allegations as  held
in HEMLAL BHANDANI  VS.    STATE  OF SIKKIM reported in AIR 1 987 SC 762.  The
plea of malice cannot be countenanced.
</p><p id="p_65">54.  Mr.R.Krishnamurthi, learned senior  counsel  appearing  for  one  of  the
petitioner  relied  upon  the  pronouncement  of  the Apex Court in JAYA GOKUL
EDUCATIONAL TRUST VS.  COMMISSIONER  &amp;  SECRETARY  TO  GOVT,  KERALA  STATE  &amp;
ANOTHER  reported  in 2000 (5) SCC 231 and contended that approval of AICTE is
sufficient for all purposes as the provisions of the AICTE Act,  1987  ensures
co-ordinated  development of technical education system throughout the country
and promotion of qualitative standards.  The learned counsel also pointed  out
that  in  terms  of the pronouncement of the Apex Court, the University cannot
impose any condition inconsistent with the AICTE Act  or  its  regulations  or
conditions  imposed  by  the council set up under the Act and the procedure in
respect of affiliation and as well as any connected conditions  stipulated  by
the  University  cannot  be inconsistent with the provisions of the AICTE Act.
The learned senior counsel relied upon  the  following  portion  of  the  said
pronouncement :-
</p><p id="p_66">"22.  As held in T.N.  case the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_42">Central Act</a> of 1987 and in particular, <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_43">Section
10(k)</a>  occupied  the  field  relating to "grant of approvals" for establishing
technical institutions and the provisions of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_44">Central Act</a> alone were to  be
complied with.   So far as the provisions of the Mahatma Gandhi University Act
or its statutes were concerned and in particular  Statute  9(7),  they  merely
required the  University  to obtain the "views" of the State Government.  That
could  not  be  characterised  as  requiring  the  "approval"  of  the   State
Government.   If, indeed, the University statute could be so interpreted, such
a provision requiring approval of the State Government would be  repugnant  to
the  provisions  of  Section  10(k)  of the AICTE Act, 1987 and would again be
void.  As pointed out in T.N.   case  there  were  enough  provisions  in  the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_45">Central  Act</a>  for  consultation by the Council of AICTE with various agencies,
including the  State  Governments  and  the  universities  concerned.      The
State-Level  Committee  and  the Central Regional Committees contained various
experts and State representatives.   In  case  of  difference  of  opinion  as
between  the  various  consultees,  AICTE would have to go by the views of the
Central Task Force.  These were sufficient  safeguards  for  ascertaining  the
views of the State Governments and the universities.  No doubt the question of
affiliation  was a different matter and was not covered by the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_46">Central Act</a> but
in T.N.  case it was held that the University could not impose any  conditions
inconsistent with the AICTE Act or its Regulation or the conditions imposed by
AICTE.   Therefore,  the  procedure  for  obtaining  the  affiliation  and any
conditions which could be imposed by the University, could not be inconsistent
with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_47">Central Act</a>.  The University could not,  therefore,
in any event have sought for "approval" of the State Government.
</p><p id="p_67">23.  Thus we hold, in the present case that there was no statutory requirement
for  obtaining the approval of the State Government and even if there was one,
it would have been repugnant to the AICTE Act.  The  University  Statute  9(7)
merely  required  that  the "views" of the State Government be obtained before
granting affiliation and this did not amount to obtaining "approval".  If  the
University  statute  required " approval", it would have been repugnant to the
AICTE Act.  Point 1 is decided accordingly."
</p><p id="p_68">55.  But in this case, it is not the contention nor it is the case of any  one
that  the  University  has  imposed a condition which is inconsistent with the
provisions of the AICTE Act or the regulations.  But  the  University  pointed
out  that the acquisition or the holding of the petitioner public trust is not
legal and, therefore, it is deemed not to be in legal possession of the  land,
which  is  the basic requirement for the purpose of establishing and running a
professional college.  There is no inconsistency or conflict at all.
</p><p id="p_69">56.  The Supreme Court in JAYA GOKUL EDUCATIONAL TRUST reported in 200  0  (5)
SCC  231 examined the question whether for establishing a professional college
approval of the State is required or it could be insisted by  the  University.
In  that  context  it  has  been held that the State could not have any policy
outside the AICTE Act and if it had a policy and indeed if it had a policy, it
should have placed the same before the AICTE and that too  before  the  latter
granted permission.     The  Apex  Court  directed  the  University  to  grant
affiliation without awaiting for any approval from the State Government as the
University should have acted on the basis of permission granted by  the  AICTE
and  other  relevant  factors under the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_48">Universities Act</a> or statutes which are
not inconsistent with AICTE Act or its regulations.
</p><p id="p_70">57.  However, it is pointed out by the senior counsel for the University  that
the committee sent by the University which inspected the site and verified the
title  deeds as regards the legal ownership of the land or holding of the land
and buildings, if any, or building accommodation provided, if any,  assistance
of  the management, constitution of the registered body and all other relevant
matters.  Therefore, it is rightly pointed out that the University could  take
the  stand that the petitioner trust in each of the writ petition has no valid
propriety right over the land or right of the management over the land or  the
building  and  building  accommodation  provided, if any, or assistance of the
management, etc., of the petitioner  trust.    In  this  respect  the  learned
counsel for respondents rightly rely upon para 21 of the pronouncement in JAYA
GOKUL EDUCATIONAL TRUST case.
</p><p id="p_71">58.   Mr.R.Krishnamurthi,  learned  senior  counsel  nextly  relied  upon  the
pronouncement of the Apex Court in AL-KARIM EDUCATIONAL TRUST  &amp;  ANOTHER  VS.
STATE  OF  BIHAR  AND  OTHERS  reported in 1996 (8) SCC 330, where the Supreme
Court held thus :-
</p><p id="p_72">"11.  In the matter of grant of affiliation, it is ordinarily  for  the  State
Government  after  consulting  the  Medical  Council  of  India to arrive at a
decision.  However, if it is found that  the  affiliation  is  being  withheld
unreasonably  or  the decision is being prolonged for one reason or the other,
this Court would, though reluctantly, be constrained to exercise jurisdiction.
We must make it clear that we are not diluting the  importance  of  fulfilling
the  essential  prerequisite  set  by  the  Medical  Council  before  granting
recognition.  The facts of this case are very special and exceptional.  In the
present case, we take note of the following aspects:
</p><p id="p_73">        (a)     The appellant-Institution was  granted  temporary  affiliation
nearly 6 years ago (29-12-1989).
</p><p id="p_74">        (b)     More  than three years ago, (on 16.7.1992) this Court directed
that students may be admitted and permitted to take  examination,  subject  to
certain conditions and this has been so done.
</p><p id="p_75">        (c)     In  view  of the earlier orders of this Court dated 28.9.1993,
the only question that  survives  for  consideration  is  whether  affiliation
should be granted to the appellants.
</p><p id="p_76">        (d)     On more than three occasions, this Court, after perusal of the
affidavits  of  the  parties and report of the authorities concerned about the
deficiencies pointed out, directed time-bound inspections, by Medical  Council
of  India,  along with other authorities bearing in mind that we are concerned
with the post-establishment stage.
</p><p id="p_77">        (e)     At one stage, it came to light that the original  deficiencies
having  been  removed,  new  or  further  deficiencies were pointed out by the
Medical Council of India, which were ordered by this Court to be removed.
</p><p id="p_78">        (f)     Finally, the appellants filed a tabular statement  along  with
an  affidavit  dated  4.9.1995, stating that even the new deficiencies pointed
out have been removed and the averments in that behalf stand uncontradicted.
</p><p id="p_79">        (g)     The appellants claim to be  a  minority  institution  and  the
difficulties/or  even  the  imponderables to start a new institution cannot be
gainsaid.  To insist on fulfilling all requirements at  a  stretch  in  modern
conditions  is  not a practical proposition and ordinarily, only those aspects
or requirements, which in the minimal will give a good start  for  effectively
imparting education, with ancillary requisites may be considered sufficient in
the extraordin ary circumstances of this case.
</p><p id="p_80">        (h)     It  is  impractical  to  insist,  for  a foolproof or absolute
adherence to all requirements without regard to their importance or relevance,
for the purpose of imparting education, in a practical way, especially because
the Institution has begun to function, students admitted  to  the  Institution
have  taken  the  examination  and  the fate of a good many number of students
should not hang in the balance in an unending or everlasting manner.
</p><p id="p_81">        (i)     In the final analysis, the question to  be  posed  is  whether
there  exists  the  minimal  and  satisfactory requirements to keep the matter
going, and not whether better arrangements that will  render  the  setup  more
efficient and more satisfactory, should be insisted as "a wooden" rule.
</p><p id="p_82">        (j)     It  may  be  that  there  are some minor deficiencies here and
there which call for  rectification.    Time  can  certainly  set  right  such
matters.  What is required is a total, practical, overall view in the light of
the  latest  tabular  statement filed along with the affidavit dated 4.9.1995.
Material  placed  before  the  court  goes  to  show  that  there   has   been
'substantial'  though not literal compliance with the deficiencies pointed out
in the latest report dated 28.6.1995.
</p><p id="p_83">        (k)     Lapse of time and the turn of events call  for  urgent  action
and  any  delay  on that score will entail untold hardship to the students and
the Institution.
</p>
<p id="p_84">12.  In the totality of the circumstances disclosed in  the  case  and  having
regard  to the fact that at each stage new deficiencies are being pointed out,
the latest being the report  dated  28.6.1995  (explained  by  the  subsequent
affidavit  of  the  appellants  dated  4.9.1995),  we are satisfied beyond any
manner of doubt, that the deficiencies have been substantially  complied  with
and  minor  deficiencies pointed out in the last mentioned report of 28.6.1995
are not such as  to  permit  withholding  of  the  affiliation  to  which  the
appellants' Institution   is   entitled.     From  the  manner  in  which  the
deficiencies have been pointed out from  time  to  time,  each  time  the  old
deficiencies are shown to have been removed, new deficiencies are shown, gives
the impression that the affiliation is unnecessarily delayed.  For the removal
of the minor deficiencies pointed out in the report of 28.6.1995, a compliance
affidavit dated  4.9.1995  is filed.  Once the Institution feels secure on the
question of affiliation, we have no doubt that these  minor  deficiencies,  if
they exist, shall be taken care of by those in charge of the Institution.  For
taking such  further  steps,  the grant of affiliation need not wait.  We make
this position  clear.    The  steps  for  the  grant  of  affiliation  to  the
appellants'  Institution may now be expedited and we direct the respondents to
issue the necessary orders without loss of time.  The appeal  is  disposed  of
accordingly.   In the facts and circumstances of the case, we make no order as
to costs."
</p><p id="p_85">Much reliance is placed on the above pronouncement as according to the  senior
learned  counsel, deficiencies which are minor should not be a stumbling block
for grant of affiliation.  This Court holds that the facts of this  batch  are
totally  different,  deficiency  being  the  very  foundation  raised  at  the
threshold by the University, the pronouncement of the Apex Court will not help
the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_86">59.  Mr.K.Doraisami, learned senior counsel appearing for  four  of  the  writ
petitioners  contended that hitherto never before neither the State Government
nor the University nor AICTE  insisted  for  production  of  permission  under
<a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_49">Section   37</a>   B  in  respect  of  the  professional  colleges  or  any  other
establishment in the State.  It is also  pointed  out  that  even  during  the
current  year,  temporary affiliation has been granted to various professional
colleges established by public trusts and  the  syndicate  of  the  respondent
University has granted affiliation without insisting for such permission under
<a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_50">Section 37</a> B.   There is no controversy in this respect.  Even during the year
2001-2002, the following are the institutions which were  granted  provisional
affiliation for courses or additional courses with Anna University :-

<p id="p_103">60.   It  is pointed out by Mr.K.Doraisamy, the learned senior counsel that in
respect of those institutions, provisional affiliation has  been  granted  for
various  courses  or for opening additional branches of engineering or MCA/MBA
courses either in a new college or a college which  has  been  established  or
affiliated  in  respect  of  some  of  the  branches  and  in respect of these
institutions, the Anna University has  not  insisted  for  the  production  of
permission under  <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_51">Section  37</a>  B.  What was the standard adopted in respect of
those institutions should be the standard the University should  have  adopted
even in respect of these petitioners as well.  The learned counsel also pleads
discrimination  and  violation  of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_52">Article 14</a> by Anna University and the State
Government.
</p><p id="p_104">61.  The plea of discrimination advanced by counsel for the petitioners cannot
be sustained at all.  Merely because the respondent university  or  AICTE,  as
the  case may be, has passed one illegal order, it will entitle the High Court
to compel the  authority  to  repeat  the  illegality  again.    The  plea  of
discrimination on  the  facts  of the case cannot be sustained.  In Chandigarh
Admn.  v.  Jagjit Singh, reported in (1 995) 1 SCC 745, the  Apex  Court  held
thus:-
</p><p id="p_105">"Generally  speaking, the mere fact that the respondent-authority has passed a
particular order in the case of another person similarly situated can never be
the ground for issuing a writ in favour of  the  petitioner  on  the  plea  of
discrimination.   The  order  in favour of the other person might be legal and
valid or it might not be.  That has to be investigated first before it can  be
directed to be followed in the case of the petitioner.  If the order in favour
of  the  other  person  is found to be contrary to law or not warranted in the
facts and circumstances of his case,  it  is  obvious  that  such  illegal  or
unwarranted  order  cannot  be made the basis of issuing a writ compelling the
respondent-authority to repeat the illegality or to pass  another  unwarranted
order.   The extraordinary and discretionary power of the High Court cannot be
exercised for such a purpose.  Merely  because  the  respondent-authority  has
passed  one  illegal/unwarranted  order, it does not entitle the High Court to
compel the authority to repeat that illegality over  again  and  again.    The
illegal/unwarranted  action  must be corrected, if it can be done according to
law - indeed, wherever it is possible, the Court should direct the appropriate
authority to correct such wrong orders in accordance with law - but even if it
cannot be corrected, it is difficult to see how it can be made a basis for its
repetition.  By refusing to direct  the  respondent-authority  to  repeat  the
illegality,  the  Court is not condoning the earlier illegal act/order nor can
such illegal  order  constitute  the  basis  for  a  legitimate  complaint  of
discrimination.   Giving  effect  to  such  pleas  would be prejudicial to the
interests of law and will do incalculable mischief to  public  interest.    It
will be a negation of law and the rule of law."
</p><p id="p_106">62.  <a href="/doc/970047/" id="a_53">In  Secy.,  Jaipur Development Authority v.  Daulat Mal Jain</a>, reported in
(1997) 1 SCC 35, the Supreme Court held thus:-
</p><p id="p_107">"27) In Chandigarh Admn.  v.  Jagjit Singh, allotment of  the  sites  was  the
subject-matter  under  several  proceedings in the High Court; ultimately some
persons had the benefit of allotment while others were  denied  of  the  same.
When  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_54">Article  14</a>  was pressed into service, this Court in para 8 at p.750 had
held that the basis of the principle, if it can be called one,  on  which  the
writ  petition  had  been  allowed  to  be  taken was unsustainable in law and
indefensible in principle.  The mere fact that  the  respondent-Authority  had
passed  a  particular  order in the case of another person similarly situated,
can never be the ground for issuing a writ in favour of the petitioner on  the
plea of  discrimination.    The  order  in favour of the other person might be
legal and valid or it might not be.  That has to be investigated first  before
it can be directed to be followed in the case of the petitioner.  If the order
in  favour of the other person is found to be contrary to law or not warranted
in the facts and circumstances of his case, it is obvious that such illegal or
unwarranted order could not be made the basis of issuing a writ compelling the
respondent-Authority to repeat the illegality  to  cause  another  unwarranted
order.   The  extraordinary  and  discretionary  power of the High Court under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_55">Article 226</a> cannot be exercised for such a purpose.
</p><p id="p_108">28.  A host of other decisions in that context have laid the  same  principle.
It is  not  necessary  to burden the judgment any further.  Suffice it to hold
that the illegal allotment founded upon ultra  vires  and  illegal  policy  of
allotment  made  to some other persons wrongly, would not form a legal premise
to ensure it to the respondent or to repeat or perpetuate such illegal  order,
nor could  it be legalised.  In other words, judicial process cannot be abused
to perpetuate the illegalities.  Thus considered, we hold that the High  Court
was  clearly  in  error  in  directing the appellants to allot the land to the
respondents."
</p><p id="p_109">The plea of discrimination or violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_56">Article 14</a> is  a  misconception  as
illegality  committed in passing one order will not be ground for perpetrating
illegality nor the respondents should be compelled to disobey the law or  rule
of law.
</p><p id="p_110">63.   Factually  also  it  is  not in dispute that neither Anna University nor
other University to which various professional colleges were affiliated or the
State Government at any point of time insisted for  production  of  permission
under Section  37  B.    According  to  the  learned senior counsel, since the
petitioners have secured approval of AICTE, provided necessary  infrastructure
with  all  necessary  equipments  and fittings as per the standards specified,
which has since been verified by the expert committee appointed  by  AICTE  as
well  as  Anna  University  and with a view to deny affiliation for extraneous
reasons such objections have been raised.
</p><p id="p_111">64.  The learned counsel also  pointed  out  that  getting  a  certificate  of
Electrical  Inspector  will  not  arise  as  these  colleges  have low tension
connection only and not high tension connection.  Therefore, the direction  to
secure certificate  of electrical inspector will not arise at all.  Electrical
Inspectors in various districts have declined to issue a certificate  in  this
respect as  no certificate is required for low tension connection.  So also in
respect of a no objection certificate from the Inspector of Factories.
</p><p id="p_112">65.  In this respect it  is  rightly  pointed  out  by  the  counsel  for  the
petitioner  in  all  the  writ petitions that the colleges established are not
factories and they do not fall under the category of factories and, therefore,
the insistence to get certificates from the Inspector of Factories also is not
called for.  Much arguments were advanced in this respect as to the insistence
for production of certificate from Pollution Control Board as  none  of  these
institutions  are  likely  to  pollute  nor  a  licence  is required under the
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_57">Pollution Control Act</a> or any other enactment connected therewith.  In  respect
of building safety certificate there is no objection for the petitioner as the
building has  to  be  used  for  public purpose of establishing a college.  In
respect of other requirements it is claimed by each  one  of  the  petitioners
that  they  have complied with most of the requirements and even in respect of
certificate from Inspector of Factories or  Electrical  Inspector  and  others
some  of  the  institutions  have  secured  certificates and some have already
applied for.
</p><p id="p_113">66.  The very fact that Anna University for the first  time  insists  for  the
above,  it is contended, would show that it is not considering the application
for affiliation in terms of the provisions of the Anna University Act  or  the
rules  or  regulations  framed  therein, but it seeks to enforce certain other
provisions in respect of which it has no authority or jurisdiction and such  a
course so adopted is not a bona fide exercise of power.
</p><p id="p_114">67.  The  Apex Court in NARENDRA KUMAR MAHESHWARI VS.  UNION OF INDIA &amp; OTHERS
reported in 1990 Supp.  SCC  440  laid  down  that  every  instrumentality  or
functionality  of  the  State  shall fulfil its own and should not trespass or
encroach or entrench upon the field of others  and  progress  is  ensured  and
development  held if each perform his role in the common endeavour, but at the
same time it  has  all  incidental  or  supplemental  powers  to  enforce  the
requirements to  advance the purpose.  However, it shall not be forgotten that
the power to demand compliance of statutory regulations or  other  requirement
will  always  include  the  power  to  insist for compliance of all incidental
matters or matters connected with, less the  compliance  of  very  requirement
will  be  rendered  futile  and  statutory  provision  or  requirement will be
rendered ineffective or defeated.
</p><p id="p_115">68.  In this respect, the Apex Court  in  JAISINGHANI  VS.    UNION  OF  INDIA
reported in 1967 SC 1427 held thus :-
</p><p id="p_116">"In  this  context  it is important to emphasize that the absence of arbitrary
power is the first  essential  of  the  rule  of  law  upon  which  our  whole
constitutional system  is  based.    In  a  system  governed  by  rule of law,
discretion, when conferred upon executive authorities, must be confined within
clearly defined limits.  The rule of law from this point of  view  means  that
decisions should be made by the application of known principles and rules and,
in  general,  such decisions should be predictable and the citizen should know
whe re he is .  If a decision is taken without any principle  or  without  any
rule  it  is unpredictable and such a decision is the antithesis of a decision
taken in accordance with  the  rule  of  law.    (See  Dicey  -  "Law  of  the
Constitution" -  Tenth  Edn.,  Introduction  ex).  "Law has reached its finest
moments," stated Douglas, J.  in United States Vs.  Wunderlich, (1951) 342  US
98,  "when  it  has  freed man from the unlimited discretion of some ruler....
Where discretion is absolute, man has always suffered".  It is in  this  sense
that the rule of law may be said to be sworn enemy of caprice.  Discretion, as
Lord Mansfield stated it in classic terms in the case of John Wilkes, (1770) 4
Burr 2528  at  p.2539  "means  sound  discretion  guided  by  law.  It must be
governed by rule, not by humour:    it  must  not  be  arbitrary,  vague,  and
fanciful"."
</p><p id="p_117">69.  In DEEPAK  THEATRE  VS.   STATE OF PUNJAB reported in 1992 SUPP.  (1) SCC
684, the Apex Court held thus :-
</p><p id="p_118">"3) .....  The question emerges whether the word  regulation  would  encompass
the power  to  fix  rates  of  admission and classification of the seats.  The
power to regulate may include the power to license or to refuse the licence or
to require taking out a licence .......  Therefore, the power  to  regulate  a
particular  business or calling implies the power to prescribe and enforce all
such proper and reasonable rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary to
conduct the business in a proper and orderly manner.   It  also  includes  the
authority to prescribe the reasonable rules, regulations or conditions subject
to which the business may be permitted or conducted."
</p><p id="p_119">70.  In  STATE  OF ANDHRA PRADESH Vs.  ANUPAMA MINERALS LTD., reported in 1995
(Supp.) 2 SCC 117 it was held that exercise of powers must be consistent  with
the provisions of the Act and if exercise of power results in violation of any
other  statutory  enactment or provision, such exercise being illegal, in view
of the prohibition, there could be no exercise of such function, nor the order
so passed is to be interfered.  In the said case,  application  was  submitted
for  grant  of  mining lease under Andhra Pradesh Mining Rules on the terms of
the lease.  After coming into force of <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_58">The Forest Conservation Act</a>, 1980,  the
State  Government  declined  to  grant  renewal  in  view  of  the prohibition
contained in <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_59">Section 2</a> of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.  The  High  Court
issued a  mandamus.    The  Apex  court  held  that in view of the prohibition
contained in the Act, namely, <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_60">The Forest Conservation Act</a>, renewal  cannot  be
granted  and upheld he stand taken by the State as any grant of renewal should
be consistent with the provisions contained in the Act and the purpose of  the
Act being  conservation  of forest and to prevent the depletion of forest.  In
that view, the Supreme Court reversed the judgement of the  High  Court  while
holding  that any direction issued will be clearly in violation of the statute
and no mandamus  or  direction  could  be  issued  to  violate  the  mandatory
provisions of the Act.  This dicta squarely applies to the facts of this case.
</p><p id="p_120">71.  Therefore, it is clear that it is always open to the authority to enforce
compliance  of  statutory  provision  or  Rule  or  Regulation,  but  also all
incidental or supplemental matters which has a bearing, less the very rule  of
law will  be  defeated by mere technicalities.  Such power has to be exercised
in furtherance and to advance the object of Rule and not to defeat the Rule of
law.
</p><p id="p_121">72.  In STATE OF TAMIL NADU VS.  ADHIYAMAN EDUCATIONAL  &amp;  RESEARCH  INSTITUTE
reported  in  1995  (4)  SCC 104, the Apex court, while holding that norms and
standards have to be reasonable and ideal and  at  the  same  time  adoptable,
tenable and maintainable by institutions throughout the country to ensure both
quantitative and qualitative growth of technically qualified personnel to meet
the  needs of the country with reference to the Madras University Act, 1923 as
to the scope and power of granting affiliation held thus :-
"29.  The  Senate  and  the  Syndicate  can  make  respectively  statutes  and
ordinances to enforce the provisions of the Act.  <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_61">The Act</a> and the statutes and
the  ordinances  made  thereunder  show that the University is given powers to
prescribe terms and conditions for affiliation also of the technical  colleges
such  as  the  engineering  colleges  and  also the power to disaffiliate such
colleges for non-fulfilment of the said conditions.  It further gives power to
the University to prescribe the qualifications of the teachers and also  their
service conditions.   The University is also given the power to inspect and to
conduct local inquiries of the affiliated colleges and to issue directions  to
the colleges on the basis of the reports of such inspection and inquiries.  It
can  prescribe  the  curricula  for  the  different  courses  conducted by the
colleges and conduct examinations to confer degrees  and  diplomas.    It  can
recommend  to  the  appropriate authorities empowered to sanction, withhold or
refuse the teaching and other grants, to decline to forward  to  the  UGC  any
application  made  by the management for sanction of any grant, to suspend the
provisional affiliation or approval  granted  to  the  college  in  course  or
courses  of study, to decline to entertain any new application for affiliation
or approval of applications for increase in strength in any course of  studies
conducted  by  the  college,  to  recommend to the Government to take over the
management of the college temporarily or permanently.   Statute  44-A  enables
the  University  to  grant  affiliation provisionally, for fixed period and to
grant extensions for such provisional affiliation.
</p><p id="p_122">30.  A comparison of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_62">Central Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_63">University Act</a> will show that  as
far  as the institutions imparting technical education are concerned, there is
a conflict between and overlapping of the functions of  the  Council  and  the
University.   Under  <a href="/doc/58320868/" id="a_64">Section 10</a> of the Central Act, it is the Council which is
entrusted with the power, particularly, to allocate and  disburse  grants,  to
evolve   suitable   performance  appraisal  systems  incorporating  norms  and
mechanisms for  maintaining  accountability  of  the  technical  institutions,
laying  down  norms and standards for courses, curricula, staff pattern, staff
qualifications, assessment and examinations, fixing norms and  guidelines  for
charging  tuition  fee  and  other  fees,  granting  approval for starting new
technical institutions or introducing new courses or programmes, to  lay  down
norms or granting autonomy to technical institutions, providing guidelines for
admission  of  students,  inspecting  or  causing  to  inspect  colleges,  for
withholding or discontinuing of grants in respect of courses  and  programmes,
declaring  institutions  at  various  levels  and types fit to receive grants,
advising the Commission constituted under  the  Act  for  declaring  technical
educational  institutions as deemed universities, setting up of National Board
of Accreditation to periodically conduct evaluation on the basis of guidelines
and standards specified and to make recommendations to it or to the Council or
the Commission  or  other  bodies  under  the  Act  regarding  recognition  or
derecognition of  the  institution or the programme conducted by it.  Thus, so
far as these matters are concerned, in the case of  the  institutes  imparting
technical education, it is not the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_65">University Act</a> and the University but it is
the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_66">Central  Act</a>  and  the  Council  created  under  it  which  will have the
jurisdiction.  To that extent, after the coming into operation of the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_67">Central
Act</a>,  the  provisions  of  the  <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_68">University  Act</a>  will be deemed to have become
unenforceable in case of technical colleges like the engineering colleges.  As
has been pointed out earlier, the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_69">Central Act</a> has been enacted  by  Parliament
under  Entry  66  of  List  I  to  co-ordinate  and determine the standards of
technical institutions as well as under Entry 25 of List III.  The  provisions
of  the  <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_70">University  Act</a>  regarding affiliation of technical colleges like the
engineering colleges and the conditions for grant  and  continuation  of  such
affiliation  by  the  University  shall,  however,  remain  operative  but the
conditions that are prescribed by the University for grant and continuance  of
affiliation  will  have  to  be  in  conformity  with the norms and guidelines
prescribed by the Council in respect of matters entrusted to it under  <a href="/doc/58320868/" id="a_71">Section
10</a> of the Central Act."
</p><p id="p_123">73.   There  is  no  dispute  that  the  petitioners  who have established the
professional colleges are following the  guidelines  evolved  by  the  Supreme
Court in  Unnikrishnan's  case  (1993  (1)  SCC  645).   The Apex Court, while
pointing out that imparting education cannot be treated as a trade or business
and held that private educational institutions have no  fundamental  right  to
their  recognition  or affiliation and such a right cannot also be inferred by
reading into <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_72">Article 19 (1) (g</a>), a right in the nature of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_73">Article 30.</a>
</p><p id="p_124">74.  In the light of the above discussions  the  points  framed  are  answered
hereunder :-
</p><p id="p_125">"i)  On  Point  "A"  this Court answers that the denial of affiliation by Anna
University by the impugned proceedings is neither illegal  nor  arbitrary  nor
discriminatory  nor  it  has  acted  in  excess  of authority in insisting for
production of permission under Section 37 B  of  The  Land  Reforms  Act  with
respect to  the  holding  of  the  lands.   Point "A" is therefore answered in
favour of the respondents and against the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_126">ii) On Point "B", this Court holds that the  Anna  University  has  not  acted
illegally or in excess of its authority in insisting for the production of the
following :-
</p><p id="p_127">"i) Prior permission under Section 37 B of The Land Reforms Act ;
</p><p id="p_128">ii)  Structural  soundness  certificate  from Superintending Engineer, PWD and
certificate from Pollution Control Board.    But  this  Court  holds  that  in
respect  of  insistence of production of certificate from Electrical Inspector
and Factories Inspectors, the demand for production of  such  certificates  is
not called  for  as  the colleges are not factories.  They are not governed by
the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_74">Factories Act</a>  nor  the  colleges  have  installed  High
Tension   power   supply,  which  alone  requires  en  Electrical  Inspector's
certificate."
</p><p id="p_129">Point "B" is ordered partly in favour of the writ petitioners  and  partly  in
favour of the respondents.
</p><p id="p_130">iii)  On  Point  "C",  though  it  may  not be strictly necessary to consider,
however as arguments were advanced, and this Court was persuaded to decide  by
either  side,  this  Court  will  not be justified in not answering the point.
<a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_75">Section 37</a> B cannot be invoked at all by the petitioner  Trusts  after  having
acquired the land without the prior permission and acquisition in violation of
Section  5  of  The  Land  Reforms  Act without prior permission is hit by the
provisions of the said enactment.  The only way for  the  petitioners,  if  at
all,  is  to  seek  exemption  from the hands of the State Government, if such
exemption is provided for under  the  Act.    Hence,  Point  "C"  is  answered
accordingly.
</p><p id="p_131">iv)  On  Point  "D",  this  Court holds that the denial of affiliation by Anna
University is not actuated either by malice or mala fides.  Hence, this  point
is also answered in favour of the respondents and against the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_132">v) On Point "E", this Court holds that the petitioners are not entitled to the
relief prayed for and, consequently, the writ petitions are dismissed."
</p><p id="p_133">75.   It  is  brought to the notice of this Court that the petitioner colleges
have already admitted students as per certain  interim  directions  they  have
secured pending  the  writ  petitions.    Without  affiliation, the petitioner
colleges cannot and will not be justified in conducting classes as at the  end
of the  year  the students have to appear for the University examinations.  In
the event of  the  petitioner  securing  necessary  exemption  or  such  other
notification  or  authorisation  to  hold the land from the State or authority
under Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_76">Land) Act</a>,  1961,  which
may enable them to hold the lands, from the State Government within four weeks
from  today, the University may reconsider its decision without delay relating
to affiliation and pass orders.  If the petitioners' are not in a position  to
produce  any permission or exemption notification or authorisation to hold, it
is needless to add that the University may advice the students who  have  been
admitted  in  the  petitioner  colleges  accordingly and the students may seek
admission in any other college approved by the AICTE and  affiliated  to  Anna
University   and   the  Secretary,  Tamil  Nadu  Engineering  Admission,  Anna
University on the students who have been admitted to the  petitioner  colleges
approaching  him,  reallocate  them  to  any  other  approved  and  affiliated
engineering colleges in the State without delay so as to enable  the  students
to take up the University examinations.
</p><p id="p_134">76.  In  the  result,  these writ petitions are dismissed.  Parties shall bear
their respective costs.  Consequently, connected miscellaneous  petitions  are
also dismissed.
