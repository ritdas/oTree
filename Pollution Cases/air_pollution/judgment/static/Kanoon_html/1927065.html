<p id="p_1">        Petitions under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Art.226</a> of the Constitution  praying  for  a  Writ  of
Certiorarified Mandamus to call for the records relating to the proceedings of
the   Disciplinary  Authority,  the  third  respondent  herein,  bearing  Ref.
No.CGS(E)/16/2005/295/2005-06  dated  10-11-2005  and  quash  the   same   and
consequently  direct  the  Disciplinary  Authority to permit the petitioner to
engage a lawyer to assist him in the Departmental Enquiry on the charge  sheet
dated 24-6-2005.
</p>

<pre id="pre_2">For Petitioner         ::  Mr.  N.G.R.  Prasad
                                for Mr.  R.  Sathiyamohan

For Respondents        ::  Mr.  Jayesh Dolia for
                        M/s.  Aiyar &amp; Dolia
:COMMON ORDER

</pre><p id="p_2">        Aggrieved  by  the  order  of  interim  injunction  dated   5-12-2005,
restraining  the  respondents  from  proceeding  with the departmental enquiry
initiated against the petitioner, the respondents have filed the petitions  to
vacate the  interim  injunction.    When  the  petitions to vacate the interim
injunction were taken up for hearing, learned counsel appearing on either side
agreed that the main writ petition  themselves  may  be  taken  up  for  final
hearing and disposal.
</p>


<p id="p_3">        2.  The facts, in brief, are as follows:
</p><p id="p_4">        Petitioner  is  working  as  the  Chief  Manager in the Administrative
Office of the second respondent bank and recently posted  as  Faculty  in  the
Staff Training  College  of  the  second respondent bank at Karur.  Petitioner
claims that he has put in 25 years of unblemished service and by virtue of his
hard work, sincerity and honesty, he has risen to the position of  Faculty  in
the second respondent bank.
</p><p id="p_5">        While  so,  the petitioner was served with five charge-sheets dated 30
</p><p id="p_6">-4-2005, 24-6-2005, 25-6-2005, 4-8-2005 and 16-8-2005, alleging  that  he  had
committed certain  lapses  while  extending  credit  facility  to  M/s.    Sri
Priyalakshmi Garments while he was  working  as  Manager  in  Tiruppur  Branch
during  the period between 1995 and 1999; that he had committed certain lapses
in the matter of  extending  credit  facilities  to  M/s.    Balapattabhi  and
M/s.R.S.L.   Industries  while  he  was  working  as the Manager of Coimbatore
branch during the period between 2000 and 200 1; that he had committed certain
irregularities in providing credit facilities to M/s.Hy-Luck Fashions when  he
was  working  as Manager of Coimbatore Branch; and that he had committed eight
different acts of irregularities when he was working as the Divisional Manager
at the Divisional Office at Karur.
</p><p id="p_7">The petitioner submitted his explanation to the above said charge sheets.
</p><p id="p_8">        The second respondent bank, not satisfied with the explanation offered
by the petitioner, initiated departmental enquiry against  the  petitioner  in
respect  of  all  the said five different charge memos and appointed the third
respondent as the Enquiry Officer and one N.    Kavirajan  as  the  Presenting
Officer.
</p><p id="p_9">        The  petitioner  gave  a representation dated 8-11-2005 requesting the
Enquiry Officer to permit him to engage a legal  practitioner  to  defend  his
case in   the   Departmental   Enquiry.      The  Disciplinary  Authority,  by
communication dated  11-11-2005,  rejected  the  request  of  the  petitioner.
Aggrieved  against  the  same,  the  petitioner  has  filed  the  present writ
petitions.
</p><p id="p_10">        The writ petitions were admitted by this Court on 5-12-2005 and by the
order of interim injunction, the respondents were restrained  from  proceeding
with the  departmental  enquiry.   The respondents have filed the petitions to
vacate the interim injunction granted by this court.
</p><p id="p_11">        As stated above, with consent of  parties,  the  main  writ  petitions
themselves  were  taken  up  for  final hearing and disposed of by this common
order and learned counsel for the parties submitted  their  arguments  in  the
main writ petitions themselves.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        3.   In  sum and substance, the grievance of the petitioner appears to
be the denial of his request to engage a lawyer as defence  representative  in
the departmental enquiry initiated against him by the second respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        4.  Shri  N.G.R.  Prasad, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted
that the petitioner has put in more than 25 years of  unblemished  service  in
the  second  respondent  bank  and  by  virtue of his hard work, sincerity and
integrity has risen to the position of Faculty.  All of a sudden,  the  second
respondent  issued  five  different  charge sheets, within a span of 100 days,
against the petitioner alleging various acts of  commission  and  omission  in
extending  credit  facilities,  incurring  expenditure  without substantiating
proof, falsification of records, suppression  of  facts,  etc.    The  charges
levelled  against  the  petitioner, on the face of it, were not sustainable as
they are false and foisted against the petitioner with a deliberate  intention
of  harassing  and  victimising  him  and  maligning his blemishless record of
service.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        5.  Learned counsel  further  submitted  that  though  the  petitioner
submitted  his  explanation  to  the  charge memos, the second respondent bank
chose to reject the same and initiated the disciplinary enquiry by  appointing
the  third  respondent  as  the  Enquiry  Officer  and  one  Kavirajan  as the
Presenting Officer.    The  said  Kavirajan  was  earlier   working   in   the
<a href="/doc/876049/" id="a_2">Disciplinary  Act</a>ion  Cell of the Canara Bank and after his joining the second
respondent bank he has  acted  as  Presenting  Officer  in  many  departmental
enquiries  and  as  such  he  is having the vast and immense experience in the
filed of domestic enquiries.  The petitioner, in order to defend his case in a
proper and effective manner, sent a representation dated  9-1-2005  requesting
permission  to  have  the  assistance  of  a  legal  practitioner  as  defence
representative in the departmental enquiry.  The second  respondent  bank,  by
the  impugned  communication  rejected  the  request  of the petitioner on the
ground that the Presenting  Officer  is  not  a  legal  practitioner  and  not
qualified in law.
</p>
<p id="p_15">        6.  Learned counsel for the petitioner assailed the the impugned order
as arbitrary and unsustainable in law.  Referring to Regulation 6( vii) of the
second  respondent bank Officers' (Discipline and Appeal) Regulation, 1993 (in
short 'the Regulation'), he argued  that  as  per  the  said  regulation,  the
charge-sheeted  officer may be permitted to engage a legal practitioner if the
presenting officer appointed is a legal practitioner or if  the  circumstances
of the  case  so  require.  In the facts and circumstances of the present case
though the presenting officer is not a legal practitioner, by  virtue  of  his
vast experience in the <a href="/doc/876049/" id="a_3">Disciplinary Act</a>ion Cell and having acted as Presenting
Officer  in  many  departmental  enquiries,  he  is  a legally trained person.
Further taking into consideration the gravity of the charges levelled  against
the  petitioner  and  the  far-reaching  consequences,  if  the  said  alleged
allegations are proved against the petitioner in the departmental enquiry, the
second respondent bank ought to have permitted  the  petitioner  to  have  the
assistance  of  a  lawyer  as  defence representative in the domestic enquiry.
Learned  counsel  also  dubbed  the  impugned  order  as  one  passed  without
application of mind and in breach of principles of natural justice.
</p>
<p id="p_16">        7.   In  support  of  his  contentions,  learned counsel relied on the
judgments in <a href="/doc/609765/" id="a_4">PUSHPA IYENGAR v.  INDIAN AIRLINES CORPORATION AND ANOTHER</a>  (1985
I LLJ 385); <a href="/doc/1622584/" id="a_5">VENKATRAMAN SAMBAMURTHY v.  UNION OF INDIA AND ANOTHER</a> (1986 I LLJ
</p><p id="p_17">62); <a href="/doc/181542/" id="a_6">C.L.   SUBRAMANIAM  v.    COLLECTOR  OF CUSTOMS, COCHIN</a> (1972 I LLJ 465);
<a href="/doc/1316469/" id="a_7">CHAIRMAN &amp; MANAGING DIRECTOR, HINDUSTAN TELEPRINTERS LTD.   v.    RAJAN  ISAAC</a>
(2005 I TLNJ 378).
</p><p id="p_18">        8.   Learned  counsel  for  the  respondents, at the out set, raised a
preliminary  objection  regarding  maintainability  of  the  writ   petitions.
According to the learned counsel, the second respondent bank is a private bank
and,  therefore, they are neither a 'State' nor an ' instrumentality or agency
of the State' nor a company which is financed and owned by  the  State  within
the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_8">Art.12</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_19">        9.   Learned  counsel  further submitted that in so far as the matters
relating to the service conditions, maintenance and enforcement of  discipline
among  the  officers  and  staff, the second respondent bank is having its own
Disciplinary Rules and Regulations.  The subject matter of the writ  petitions
is  with  reference  to  the  disciplinary  proceedings  initiated against the
petitioner under the Regulation, the Reserve Bank of India has no role to play
in the matter.  Reserve Bank of India has been impleaded as a party respondent
obviously with a  view  to  clothe  the  jurisdiction  under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_9">Art.226</a>  of  the
Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_20">        10.   Learned  counsel,  relying on the decisions in <a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_10">FEDERAL BANK LTD.
v.  SAGAR THOMAS AND OTHERS</a> (2003 AIR SCW 4995) and <a href="/doc/1366932/" id="a_11">PITCHUMANI v.   MANAGEMENT
OF SRI  CHAKRA TYRES LTD</a>.  (2004 (3) CTC 1) and also an unreported decision of
this Court in W.P.  No.8004 of 2004 (B.  Gurunathan v.   Lakshmi  Vilas  Bank)
delivered  on  24-6-2004,  submitted that no writ will lie against any private
bank and therefore the writ petitions are liable to be dismissed in limine  as
not maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_21">        11.   On  the  merits of the case, learned counsel for the respondents
submitted that Regulation 6(vii) provides that  the  delinquent  employee  may
have the assistance of a legal practitioner only in cases where the Presenting
Officer appointed  by  the Disciplinary Authority is a legal practitioner.  In
the present case, since the Presenting Officer is neither a legal practitioner
nor a person qualified in law, the petitioner's request was  rightly  rejected
in terms  of  Regulation  6( vii).  Learned counsel further submitted that the
petitioner himself is a person well-versed in the departmental proceedings  as


he  himself  acted  as  Enquiry  Officer  in many departmental proceedings and
therefore he is familiar with the  procedures  involved  in  the  departmental
enquiry.
</p>
<p id="p_22">        12.   Learned  counsel,  relying  on the decisions in <a href="/doc/106689727/" id="a_12">BHARAT PETROLEUM
CORPORATION LTD.  v.  MAHARASHTRA GENERAL KAMGAR UNION</a> (AIR 1999 SC  401)  and
<a href="/doc/1316469/" id="a_13">CHAIRMAN AND  MANAGING DIRECTOR, HINDUSTAN TELEPRINTERS v.  RAJAN ISAAC</a> (2005)
II LLJ 610 Mad.; submitted that a delinquent has no right to be represented in
the departmental  proceedings  by  a  lawyer  unless  the  service  rules  and
regulations provide  for the same.  Learned counsel submitted that the present
writ petitions have  been  filed  only  with  an  intention  to  protract  the
departmental proceedings.  Learned counsel, therefore, submitted that the writ
petitions are liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_23">        13.   In reply to the above preliminary objection, learned counsel for
the petitioner submitted that not only the banking operations  of  the  second
respondent  bank,  but  its  internal  management  and affairs relating to its
officers and staff is under the direct supervision and control of the  Reserve
Bank of  India.  The rules and regulations regarding the service conditions of
the officers and staff are given effect to only  after  the  approval  by  the
Reserve Bank of India.
</p>
<p id="p_24">        14.   Learned  counsel  further  submitted that even assuming that the
second respondent bank is a private bank, there are well recognised exceptions
to the general rule that no writ will lie against a private person, viz.  when
there is a non-compliance or violation of a  statutory  provision;  where  the
impugned  action  patently  suffers  from  jurisdictional  error  or  ex facie
arbitrary and illegal or affects the Fundamental Rights of the  petitioner  or
not in  conformity  with  the  principles  of  natural  justice,  etc.    In a
departmental enquiry full and adequate opportunity  should  be  given  to  the
delinquent employee to put forth his defence in an effective and proper manner
and  for  that  purpose he could even seek the assistance of a qualified legal
practitioner to defend his case and denial of such opportunity, if sought for,
is nothing but breach of principles  of  natural  justice.    Learned  counsel
further  argued  that  when  Regulation 6(vii) of the Regulations specifically
provides for such assistance, denial of such assistance to the  petitioner  is
illegal and arbitrary.
</p>
<p id="p_25">        15.   Learned  counsel  stretched his arguments further to submit that
taking into consideration the number of charges alleged against the petitioner
and the gravity thereof and the vast experience of the Presenting  Officer  in
the  field  of  Departmental Enquiries, if the petitioner could not defend his
case in an effective and proper manner by having the  assistance  of  a  legal
practitioner,  the  consequences  would be far-reaching and have the effect of
affecting the petitioner's livelihood.  Learned  counsel  therefore  submitted
that  for  all  these reasons, the present case is undoubtedly an exception to
the general rule that no writ will lie against a private/scheduled bank.
</p>
<p id="p_26">        16.  Heard the  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  and  perused  the
records.  The questions that arise for consideration are:
</p><p id="p_27">1.Whether the writ petitions are maintainable in law and on facts?
</p><p id="p_28">2.Whether  the  second  respondent bank, in the facts and circumstances of the
case, is justified in denying the petitioner's request to have the  assistance
of a legal practitioner to defend his case in the departmental enquiry?
</p>
<p id="p_29">        17.   On  the  question  of maintainability, learned counsel submitted
that not only the banking operations but  even  the  internal  management  and
affairs of the bank including the service conditions of the officers and staff
of the second respondent bank come under the direct supervision and control of
the  first respondent  Reserve Bank of India and, therefore, the present writ
petitions are maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_30">        18.  Learned counsel further vehemently argued that it is now  a  well
settled  law  that a writ petition is maintainable even against a private body
when the impugned action of  such  private  body  infringes  the  petitioner's
Fundamental Rights  guaranteed  under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_14">Art.21</a> of the Constitution of India.  On
the backdrop of this premise, learned counsel submitted that by  the  impugned
order  the petitioner is deprived of the assistance of a legal practitioner to
defend his case in the departmental enquiry and if the  petitioner  could  not
defend  his  case  effectively  and properly for want of assistance of a legal
practitioner, the results would be far reaching and may  have  the  effect  of
affecting his livelihood, which is now recognised by the Courts as Fundamental
Right under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_15">Art.21</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>

<p id="p_31">        19.  The contentions of the learned counsel for the petitioner, in the
facts of  the  present  case,  are  not  sustainable in law and on facts.  The
contention of the learned counsel that even though the second respondent  bank
is  a  private  bank, it comes under the direct control and supervision of the
first respondent bank is  wholly  unsustainable.    True  it  is,  the  second
respondent  bank,  though  a  private  bank, its' banking operations in strict
sense such as lending operations, maintenance of  statutory  liquidity  ratio,
maintenance  of  cash  reserve,  rate  of  interest  on  loans, maintenance of
accounts, periodical audit, etc.  are controlled by the  statutory  rules  and
regulations  and  the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India from time
to time.  However, the internal matters such as maintaining and enforcing  the
discipline  among  the  officers and staff, the second respondent bank has its
own rules and regulations.  The said rules and regulations, though required to
be approved by the Reserve Bank of India, are distinct and independent.    The
impugned  order  has  been  passed  under  Regulation  6(vii)  of  the  second
respondent  bank  Officers'  (Discipline  and   Appeal)   Regulations,   1993.
Therefore, there is no question of breach of any statutory provision or any of
the  rules  or regulations or even any guideline issued by the Reserve Bank of
India.  In such circumstances, the impleadment of the first respondent Reserve
Bank of India as a party respondent to the writ petitions is unnecessary  and,
as  rightly contended by the learned counsel for the respondents, Reserve Bank
of India has been ingenuously impleaded  as  a  party  only  with  a  view  to
circumvent the maintainability hurdle.
</p>
<p id="p_32">        20.   The  second  limb  of  argument  that the impugned order has the
potential and possibility of affecting the livelihood of  the  petitioner  and
thereby  infringes  his  Fundamental  Right  guaranteed  under  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_16">Art.21</a>  is too
stretched  argument  and,  in  the  facts  of  the  present   case,   such   a
wide-stretched argument cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_33">        21.  <a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_17">In FEDERAL BANK LIMITED v.  SAGAR THOMAS AND OTHERS</a> (2003[10] SCC
</p><p id="p_34">733) the question whether the appellant bank is a private body or falls within
the definition of the State or local or other authorities under the control of
the Government  within  the  meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_18">Art.12</a> came up for consideration.  The
facts of the said case are more or the less similar nay  identical.    In  the
said  case,  a  dismissed employee of the private bank challenged the order of
dismissal by filing a writ petition before the  High  Court.    A  preliminary
objection  regarding  maintainability of the writ petition against the private
bank was raised.  The High Court on the ground that the bank is  performing  a
public  duty  and  a  positive  obligation towards its employees and customers
exists held that the writ petition is maintainable, which finding  was  upheld
by the  Division  Bench.  While upsetting the orders passed by the High Court,
the Supreme Court, on the question of maintainability, observed as follows:
"Private companies would normally not be amenable  to  the  writ  jurisdiction
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_19">Art.226</a> of the Constitution.  But in certain circumstances a writ may be
issued  to  such private bodies or persons as there may be statutes which need
to be complied with  by  all  concerned  including  private  companies.    For
example,  <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_20">Wages  Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_21">Factories Act</a> or for maintaining proper environment,
say the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_22">Control of  Pollution)  Act</a>,  1981  or  the  Water
(Prevention and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_23">Control  of  Pollution)  Act</a>, 1974, etc.  or statutes of like
nature which fasten certain duties and responsibilities statutorily upon  such
private bodies  which  they  are bound to comply with.  If they violate such a
statutory provision a writ would certainly be issued for compliance with those
provisions.  For instance, if a private employer dispenses with the service of
its employee in violation of the provisions  contained  under  the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_24">Industrial
Disputes  Act</a>, in innumerable cases the High Court has interfered and issued a
writ to private bodies and companies in that regard.  But  the  difficulty  in
issuing  a  writ  may  arise where there may not be any non-compliance with or
violation of any statutory provision by the private body.  In that event  even
a writ  may  not  be  issued at all.  Other remedies, as may be available, may
have to be resorted to." (emphasis supplied)
The Supreme Court further observed:
</p><p id="p_35">"Merely because Reserve Bank of India lays the banking policy in the  interest
of  the  banking  system  or  in  the  interest of monetary stability or sound
economic growth having due regard to the interests of  depositors,  etc.    as
provided  under  Sec.5(c)(a) of the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_25">Banking Regulations Act</a> does not mean that
private companies carrying on the business or commercial activity of  banking,
discharge any  public  function  or  public  duty.    These are all regulatory
measures applicable to those carrying on commercial activity  in  banking  and
these companies are to act according to these provisions failing which certain
consequences follow as indicated in the Act itself.  ...  ...  ...  Therefore,
a  private company carrying on banking business as a scheduled bank, cannot be
termed as an institution or a company carrying  on  any  statutory  or  public
duty.  ...  ...    ...  Merely regulatory provisions to ensure that commercial
activity carried on by private bodies work within a discipline, neither confer
any status upon the company nor put any  obligations  upon  it  which  may  be
enforced through issuance of a  writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_26">Art.226.</a>  ...  ...  ...  Present is
a case of disciplinary  action  being  taken  against  its  employees  by  the
appellant Bank.    The  respondent's  service with the Bank stands terminated.
The action of the Bank was challenged by  the  respondent  by  filing  a  writ
petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_27">Art.226.</a>  The respondent is not trying to enforce any statutory
duty on the part of the Bank."
</p><p id="p_36">The Supreme  Court again by its recent decision in <a href="/doc/261493/" id="a_28">BINNY LIMITED v.  SADASIVAN</a>
(AIR 2005 SC 3202), following its earlier decision in Federal Bank case, cited
supra, held that writ petition  against  the  termination  of  service  of  an
employee  of a private company is not maintainable as no public law element is
involved.  A learned single Judge of this  Court,  following  the  above  said
decisions of  the Supreme Court, dismissed the writ petition (W.P.  No.8004 of
2004 order dated 24-6-2004) filed  challenging  the  disciplinary  proceedings
initiated  against  him  by  the  very  same  second  respondent  bank, as not
maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_37">        22.  The second contention of the learned counsel  that  the  impugned
order  has  been  passed  in utter breach of the principles of natural justice
cannot be countenanced.  <a href="/doc/775461/" id="a_29">In CRESCENT DYES AND CHEMICALS LTD.  v.   RAM  NARESH
TRIPATHI</a> (1993[2]SCC 115), the Supreme Court held:
</p><p id="p_38">"The  requirement  of the rules of natural justice insofar as the delinquent's
right of hearing is concerned, cannot and does not extend to  a  right  to  be
represented through counsel or agent."
</p><p id="p_39">        23.   It  also cannot be stated that the imugned order has been passed
without jurisdiction as Regulation  6(vii)  of  the  second  respondent  bank'
Officers'   (Discipline   and   Appeal)  Regulations  confers  powers  on  the
Disciplinary Authority to entertain or reject the request of the delinquent.
</p>
<p id="p_40">        24.  It is not shown before this Court that the second respondent bank
while passing the impugned order has failed to comply with or violated any  of
the statutory  provisions.  Therefore, considering the facts and circumstances
of the present case in the light of the  authoritative  pronouncement  of  the
Supreme Court in Federal Bank Limited case, cited supra, I am of the view that
the  writ  petitions  are  liable to be dismissed in limine on the question of
maintainability.
</p>
<p id="p_41">        25.  Coming to the  merits  of  the  case,  learned  counsel  for  the
petitioner  citing  a  number of authorities of the Supreme Court as well this
Court, more particularly the decision in the case of C.L.  Subramaniam,  cited
supra,  vehemently  argued  that  the  term  "legal practitioner" occurring in
Regulation 6(vii) of the Regulations should not be construed in a strict sense
only to mean the persons qualified in law and the legal  practitioners.    The
said  term  should  be  interpreted  to  mean and include not only the persons
qualified in law and legal practitioners in strict sense of the term but  also
legally trained  persons.    Learned  counsel  submitted  that  the Presenting
Officer appointed by the  second  respondent  bank,  by  virtue  of  his  vast
experience  of  his  working in the <a href="/doc/876049/" id="a_30">Disciplinary Act</a>ion Cell of a Nationalised
Bank and having successfully presented the case  of  the  Management  in  many
departmental   enquiries,   is  undoubtedly  a  legally  trained  person  and,
therefore, he will an upper advantage vis-a-vis  the  petitioner  who  is  not
familiar with the procedures and formalities of the departmental enquiry.
</p>
<p id="p_42">        26.  I have carefully gone through the decision in Subramaniam's case,
cited supra, on which heavy reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the
petitioner.   In  the said case, the delinquent, who was a member of the civil
service of the Union of India, was removed from  service,  which  is  a  major
penalty.   The procedure for imposing major penalties is prescribed in Rule 15
of the Central Civil Services ( Classification,  Control  and  Appeal)  Rules,
1957, a rule framed under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_31">Art.309</a> of the Constitution and sub-rule (5) of that
rule  provided  that  the  Government  servant  may  present his case with the
assistance of any Government servant approved by  the  disciplinary  authority
but  may  not  engage  a  legal practitioner for the purpose unless the person
nominated by the disciplinary authority as aforesaid was a legal  practitioner
or  unless  the  disciplinary authority, having regard to the circumstances of
the case, so permits.  The delinquent sought permission to engage a counsel to
appear on his behalf and defend him during  the  enquiry.    The  request  was
rejected  on  the  ground  that  though  the  Presenting Officer was a legally
trained, he was not a legal practitioner.  The departmental enquiry  proceeded
and ultimately  the  delinquent was removed from service.  On the delinquent's
challenge to the said order by way of writ petition, the High Court  dismissed
the writ  petition.    In  the appeal before the Supreme Court, the delinquent
raised  the  main  contention  that  since  he  was  not  given  a  reasonable
opportunity  to  present  case,  there  was  a  violation  of  Rule  15(5) and
consequently the impugned order was liable to be struck down.    Allowing  the
appeal,  the  Supreme Court held that the delinquent was a member of the civil
services of the Union of India and in view of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_32">Art.311</a> of the Constitution,  he
could  not  be  removed  from service except after enquiry in which reasonable
opportunity was given to him and breach of this procedural guarantee  vitiated
the enquiry.  The relevant observations of the Supreme Court are as follows:
"From  the  facts  set out above, it is clear that the enquiry officer did not
afford the appellant necessary facility to  have  the  assistance  of  another
Government  servant in defending him which assistance he was entitled to under
the rule.    He  was  deprived  of  that  assistance  solely  because  of  the
indifferent attitude  adopted  by  the enquiry officer.  Therefore, we have no
hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the enquiry  officer  had  clearly
breached Rule 15(5)." (emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_43">        27.   The dicta laid down by the Supreme Court in the said decision is
not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case.  That was a
case concerning the dismissal of a Government servant, and being a  member  of
the  Civil  Service,  his  service  conditions  were governed by the rules and
regulations framed under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_33">Art.309</a> of the Constitution of India and in  view  of
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_34">Art.311</a> of the Constitution, he could not be removed from service except after
enquiry  in  which  he had been given a reasonable opportunity of being heard;
though he had initially sought for the assistance  of  a  legal  practitioner,
later  he  requested  the  disciplinary  authority to permit him to engage the
assistance of another Government servant, which he was entitled to  under  the
relevant  rule,  and that he was deprived of that assistance solely because of
the indifferent attitude adopted by  the  enquiry  officer.    Therefore,  the
impugned  order  was  quashed  by the Supreme Court not on the ground that the
delinquent was not permitted to engage a legal practitioner but on the  ground
that  the  delinquent  was  deprived  of  the assistance of another Government
servant which he was entitled to under the relevant  rule.    In  the  present
case, the impugned order has been passed rejecting the claim of the petitioner
to engage the legal practitioner and there was no claim made by the petitioner
to take  the assistance of a co-employee.  If the petitioner wants to take the
assistance  of  the  co-employee,  the  respondent  bank  have  no  objection.
Therefore,  the  decision has no bearing on the facts and circumstances of the
present case.
</p>
<p id="p_44">        28.  Under Regulation 6(vii) of  the  second  respondent  Officers'  (
Discipline  and  Appeal)  Regulations  a  charge-sheeted  officer  facing  the
departmental enquiry may take the assistance of any other officer of the  bank
but  may not engage a legal practitioner for the purpose unless the Presenting
Officer appointed by the Disciplinary Authority is a legal practitioner.   The
Presenting   Officer   appointed  by  the  respondent  bank  is  not  a  legal
practitioner and, therefore, in terms of the said regulation,  the  petitioner
is not entitled to ask of the assistance of a legal practitioner to defend him
in the  departmental  enquiry.    In Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Limited case,
cited supra, on the question of right of representation by  a  counsel  or  an
agent of delinquent's choice, the Supreme Court observed as follows:
"Ordinarily  it is considered desirable not to restrict the delinquent's right
to be represented by counsel or an agent of his choice, but it is a  different
thing  to  say  that  such  a right is an element of the principles of natural
justice and denial thereof would invalidate the enquiry.    The  right  to  be
represented  through  counsel or agent unless can be restricted, controlled or
regulated by statutes, rules and regulations or standing orders.  A delinquent
has no right to be  represented  through  counsel  or  agent  unless  the  law
specifically confers  such  a  right.    The  requirement  of rules of natural
justice in so far as the delinquent's right of hearing  is  concerned,  cannot
and  does not extend to a right to be represented through counsel or agent." (
emphasis supplied)
The Supreme Court further observed:
</p><p id="p_45">"The object and purpose of such provisions are to  ensure  that  the  domestic
enquiry is  completed with despatch and is not prolonged endlessly.  Secondly,
when  the  person  defending  the  delinquent  is  from  the   department   or
establishment  in  which  the delinquent is working he will be well conversant
with the working  of  that  department  and  the  relevant  rules  and  would,
therefore, be able to render satisfactory service to the delinquent.  Thirdly,
not   only  would  the  entire  proceedings  be  completed  quickly  but  also
inexpensively.  It is, therefore, not correct to  contend  that  the  standing
order or <a href="/doc/876049/" id="a_35">Section 22(ii)</a> conflicts with the principles of natural justice."
</p>
<p id="p_46">        29.   Further, in their counter-affidavits, the second respondent bank
as well as  the  Disciplinary  Authority,  while  denying  the  claim  of  the
petitioner  that he has no experience in departmental enquiries submitted that
the  petitioner  himself  has  been  appointed  as  Enquiry  Officer  in  many
departmental  proceedings  initiated  by  the bank and that the enquiries were
conducted successfully by him and, therefore, the petitioner  is  well  versed
with the procedures involved in the departmental proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_47">        30 For the reasons stated above , I am of the considered view that the
writ petitions are devoid of merits and are liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_48">        31.  The writ petitions are, therefore, dismissed.  No costs.  Interim
order shall stand  vacated.  Connected W.P.M.P.  Nos.2685 to 2689 of 2 005 and
W.V.M.P.  Nos.41904 to 41908 of 2005 are closed.
