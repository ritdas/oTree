              Development Corporation (MIDC) Waluj industrial area is

              not notified as Chemical Industrial Zone, the authorities

              have allowed several chemical factories including the listed

              Respondents in 1989 to operate such chemical industries

              within the area. The Applicant further submits that since

              commissioning of these chemical factories and unabated

              discharge of polluted effluents mainly from six (6) industries,

              the source of drinking water of the village is contaminated

              and the villagers are getting polluted water for drinking

              purpose.            Applicant further claims that such supply of

              polluted water is causing health hazards to the local

              residents.          According to the Applicant, the Respondent-

              Industries          are   not   treating   their   industrial   effluents

              adequately and discharge in open area which meets the

              and typical smell.

              submitted actions taken by the Board against some of the

              industries.         The Affidavit also records that from the

              comparative statement of the analysis done by the Board, it

              is observed that for the above period i.e. 2003 to 2013 the

              pollutional discharges have caused surface and Ground

              Water contamination till CETP came into operation.            The

              Affidavit also reports that overall results of the CETP are

              conforming the standards prescribed.              However, this

              Affidavit does not contain identification of source of

              pollution and also does not locate identity of polluting

              industries as directed in our order dated January 2nd, 2014.

              Considering this, the Central Ground Water Board, Nagpur

              was directed vide Order dated January 23rd 2014 to verify

              the water pollution levels and also, whether there is any

              environmental        damage   caused   due   to   the   industrial

              discharges and also, for development of remedial plan.

              important conclusions :
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">                 a) The TDS values in excess of 2000 mg/L in ground water
                    samples collected in and around Ranjangaon(s),
                    Kamlapur, Ramrai and Ramraiwadi villages indicate
                    that the ground water pollution has already been
                    initiated in the area and reached to moderate level.
</p><p id="p_15">                 b) The TDS, Ca, Mg and Cl have been observed more than
                    MPL in and around Ranjangaon (S), Kamlapur and

                       Ramraiwadi indicating the deterioration of ground water
                      due to pollution.
</p><p id="p_16">                 c)   The concentration of nitrate content was above MPL in
                      background samples collected from Shajapur and
                      Vitava and also in the core areas of Waluj MIDC around
                      Ranjangaon (S). The higher values of nitrate, indicates
                      ground water pollution due to both improper disposal of
                      sewage and solid waste of the town and industrial
                      effluents/waste.
</p><p id="p_17">                 d)   The ground water of shallow aquifer is relatively more
                      polluted than deeper aquifer. Except nitrate, where the
                      concentration of nitrate is found more in deeper aquifer
                      indicating contamination due to anthropogenic activity.
</p><p id="p_18">                 e)   As per MPCB, A-II standards, it is observed that in all
                      the samples, all the trace metals are within permissible
                      limits, except Chromium (Cr). The high concentration of
                      Cr (0.118 mg/L) was found at sampling point
                      WLI/CETP-019 i.e., CETP outlet point, however, the
                      same is within permissible limit at the discharge point.
</p><p id="p_19">                 f)   This indicates that the surface water is also being
                      contaminated due to industrial pollution in and around
                      Ranjangaon(S) village area, Ramralwadi, Pardeshwadi
                      (Jogeshwari) irrigation tank and Discharge Point. It also
                      indicates that untreated effluent is still being discharged
                      by some industries into the nala thereby leading to
                      pollution of surface water.
</p><p id="p_20">                 g)   It has been observed that the treated effluent at CETP
                      and discharge point has pungent smell, blackish green
                      colour and TDS values of 2566 mg/L and 2548 mg/L
                      respectively which is beyond the permissible limits of
                      MPCB, A-II standards and the same is being still
                      discharged in Kham river near Patoda and Pandharpur
                      villages.
</p><p id="p_21">                 h)   The CETP has been operational since July 2011 and
                      prior to the functioning of CETP, the treated/untreated
                      effluent was disposed off on the land by the industries.
                      Thus, the presence of TDS, Ca, Mg. Cl, Cr. Ni and Mn in
                      more than MPL of BIS drinking water standards (2012)
                      in ground water and low DO levels, high concentration
                      of MN, TDS, CL and Cr in surface water (as per EPR,
                      1986 and MPCB, A-II standards) indicates that the long
                      term discharge of treated/untreated effluent on the
                      surface without adhering to the prescribed standards
                      has lead to surface and ground water pollution in the
                      area.
</p><p id="p_22">                 i)   Presently the CETP is receiving only 2 MLD effluents
                      and thus functioning at 20 % of its capacity. This
                      indicates that the entire effluent generated by the
                      industries is perhaps not being received in CETP.
                      Perhaps, the untreated effluent is being discharged into

              July, 2014 and presented a Report prepared by MPCB, titled

              "Proposed Action Plan Industrial Cluster at Aurangabad".

              The report is said to be prepared by MPCB in order to

              comply          the   directions   of   MoEF   /CPCB     related   to

              comprehensive environmental pollution index (CEPI) and

              available to MPCB website. This fact was also accepted by

              the MPCB officials present in the Tribunal.           The Report is

              quite exhaustive and deals with the status of Pollution in the

              Industrial estates in District Aurangabad, identification of

              polluting sources, and also detailed action plan to control

              the pollution. The report also refers to study conducted by

              NEERI about the Ground Water Pollution in the area as

              referred in the present Application.           We do not know the

              reasons why such important information and Reports have

              not been adduced before the Tribunal in spite of our clear

              directions to the Member Secretary of the Board.

              its Affidavit dated 2nd January, 2014 presented the Water

              Quality data of the percolation tank in question, well and

              nalla and has concluded that the water quality is found

              exceeding the prescribed limit. Even in the Report on Action

              Plan referred above, MPCB has enclosed the water quality

              data and has concluded that the quality of water in

              percolation tank has been deteriorated. In fact, it is found

              from the report on Action plan that MPCB had even

              proposed to prepare remedial Action Plan.

               including agriculture.           Needless to say that protecting the

              ground              water      quality    and      controlling    the

              pollution/contamination of the ground water is the necessity

              of hour. It is also to be noted that the ground water system

              is quite complex and once polluted, it is a Herculean task,

              even to assess the level and extent of pollution, even with the

              latest analytical and modeling techniques and therefore, it is

              utmost necessary to adopt the 'Precautionary principle' while

              dealing with the protection and conservation of the Ground

              Water Quality.              Under these circumstances, it becomes

              necessary that adequate and prompt remedial measures

              should be planned and implemented for the said purpose. It

              is observed from the MPCB Report that MPCB has already

              identified need of such remedial measures and had also

              referred to the studies carried out by NEERI in the past.

              MPCB has mentioned in para 4.2.1 of the Report that the

              remediation plan will be prepared soon.             We do not know

              whether such plan has been prepared or otherwise as no

              relevant documents are placed before the Tribunal.

               industries have taken a stand that they have provided

              necessary pollution control systems and operating the same

              within the parameters defined by MPCB.           Some industries

              have also taken a stand that this ground water pollution

              may be due to industrial discharges over a long period of

              about 15 to 20 years i.e legacy discharges, and some of the

              industries claim to be in-operation only for a short time.

              During the arguments, it was also indicated that in the

              absence of CETP, individual units were treating their

              effluents and discharging it on land for irrigation.         And,

              therefore, though individual units were operating within

              prescribed norms, the cumulative impacts could have been

              responsible.        Therefore, the stand of industries is that the

              MIDC which was required to provide CETP should also be

              part of this Application. We are aware of such scenario and

              are of the opinion that these industries can not shirk their

              responsibility and are liable for implementing ground water

              remedial action plan as and when formulated. The issues

              raised by these industries could only be relevant in terms of

              equitable distribution of cost that can be imposed on the

              industries towards the remedial measures. It is matter of

              record that the ground water remedial measures involve

              significant costs and necessarily such costs need to be paid

              by concerned industries.          This is a fit case where the

                          such as Lilason Industries Ltd., Innotech Pharma Ltd.,

                          water in percolation tank which acts as a ground

                          ground water pollution of nearby areas. To avoid
                          further groundwater pollution, the percolation tank
                          (stagnant water reservoir) should be filled. Industries

<p id="p_51">              29.         Considering the above discussion, we find that MPCB

              has already prepared road map for implementation for

              remediation measures for the Ground Water Quality and the

              Soil Quality in the area under question. The only hurdle is

              absence of initiation of such Action Plan and we really don't

              know the reasons thereof.         It is necessary that the MPCB

              shall revisit the remedial Action Plan, if prepared earlier, in

              line with CGWB Report and then finalise the remediation

              Action Plan.

<p id="p_52">
</p><p id="p_53">              30.         It is placed on record that the MIDC Waluj area

              accommodates about 1520 Industrial units of which 316 are

              in highly polluting or red category. The CETP is in operation

              since 2012 which has a capacity of 10 MLD.             As per the

              record the total generation of waste water in Waluj

              industrial area is 10.4 MLD or so.          However, CGWB has

              reported that the CETP is in operation only with two (2) MLD

              capacity due to shortage of incoming effluents. CGWB has

              further reported that the CETP is also not discharging the

              desired quality of effluent.          All these facts speak for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">(J) Application No.11(THC)/2013                                                 24</span>
               themselves though not disclosed by MPCB. More than eight

              (8) MLD industrial effluent is still not reaching CETP and

              being discharged either on land or in nalas with or without

              treatment. These facts demonstrate that enforcement levels

              in MIDC Waluj are not to the desirable level.           When the

              matter was taken up by the Tribunal, MPCB observed some

              non compliances and actions were initiated. We hope that

              such actions are not for the sake of Tribunal proceedings

              and consistent enforcement measures are taken by MPCB.

              During such inspections, MPCB found M/s. Endurance

              System          discharging   Chrome   Bearing   effluent   outside

              premises and has issued directions of closure against the

              industry. The industry has also filed M.A. No. 145/2014 in

              connection with such closure with a prayer to direct MPCB

              to give hearing before restart. What we found interesting is

              that this industry has also been identified as source of

              pollution by NEERI as reported in MPCB's Report.            In fact,

              there are serious observations regarding the Chrome content

              in the Ground water in wells in the vicinity of these

              industries.         In spite of all such previous record, such

              industries continue to discharge highly toxic effluent bearing

              Chrome, into the environment which shows the apathy,

              these industries have towards the environmental protection.

              We are, therefore, not inclined to accept any request for

              expeditious hearing by MPCB and we leave it to Member

              are in place and are capable of meeting standards at all

              upon,        including     independent   expert   appraisal,   before

              considering such restart. However, the industry is at liberty

              to challenge such order of closure or such directions given

              by MPCB, as per the legal avenues available to them, if

              deemed fit and necessary. The MA 145/2014 is accordingly

              disposed of.
