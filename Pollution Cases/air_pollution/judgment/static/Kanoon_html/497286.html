                       Crl.M.C.No.17 of 2011

                   ---------------------------------------

               Dated this 21st day of January, 2011

                                 ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Petitioner is aggrieved by the condition imposed by the

learned Judicial First Class Magistrate-II, Thamarassery while

releasing the vehicle involved vide order on C.M.P.No.4353 of

2010 in Crime No.520 of 2010 of Mukkom Police Station. Vehicle

belonging to the petitioner was seized allegedly for draining

sewage into the river and thereby committing offence punishable

under Secs.24(i) r/w Sec.43 of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control) of Pollution Act</a>, 1974. Learned Magistrate while

ordering release of the vehicle, among other conditions directed

that petitioner, not to repeat such offence using the said vehicle,

shall deposit `.1,00,000/- in cash. Petitioner is aggrieved by that

condition. It is submitted by learned counsel that the condition

imposed is harsh and petitioner is not able to deposit the said

amount. Learned counsel states that other appropriate conditions

are already fixed by the learned Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.    I have heard learned Public Prosecutor also.

</p><p id="p_3">      3.    It is seen from the order under challenge that learned

Magistrate while ordering release of the vehicle has imposed

Crl.M.C.No.17 of 2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                -: 2 :-</span>


appropriate conditions. There is also a direction that the vehicle

shall not be used for (commission of) any offence during the

period of (its) interim custody. In view of that condition I am

inclined to think that it was not necessary to direct deposit of

cash security. Hence the condition imposed by the learned

Magistrate vide the impugned order to deposit cash security of

`.1,00,000/- is to be set aside. But it is directed that in case any

of the other conditions imposed by the learned Magistrate is

violated it would forfeit the bond.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      Resultantly this criminal miscellaneous case is allowed and

the condition imposed by the learned Magistrate vide order dated

October 20, 2010 on C.M.P.No.4353 of 2010 in Crime No.520 of

2010 of Mukkom Police Station directing deposit of Rs. One Lakh

in cash as security is set aside. But it is directed that violation of

any other condition would result in forfeiture of the bond.
