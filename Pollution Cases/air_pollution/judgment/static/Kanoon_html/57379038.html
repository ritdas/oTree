Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">		Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a 
Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court 
dismissing the Writ Petition filed by the appellants. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">	Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_4">	The Writ Petition was filed in the year 1994, taking the 
stand that industries by non official residents were operating 
in residential areas and, therefore, they were liable to be 
closed. This stand was resisted by the respondents on the 
ground that the factories in question were situated in Sector 
16 which in terms of the Old Master Plan was an industrial 
area. Therefore, the grievances of the writ petitioners were 
without substance. The High Court asked for report of the 
Punjab Pollution Control Board (in short the 'Board'). The 
Board's report which is re-produced in the order of the High 
Court reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_5">"Lastly the action taken report was filed on 
8.4.2002 by the Board showing that 61 units 
have complied with the provisions of the Air 
(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. 
Out of remaining 27 units, 16 units have been 
closed down by the Board under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_2">Section 
21</a>/<a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_3">31-A</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of 
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. 8 Units have closed down 
their units themselves. Remaining 3 number 
units have not installed Air Pollution control 
devices. Thereafter 2 more units have installed 
Air Pollution Control Devices and 1 unit has 
changed its fuel from furnace oil to Liquid 
Petroleum Gas (LPG) in which Air Pollution 
Control Devices is not required. Hence, all the 
remaining industrial units have complied with 
the provisions of the Air (Prevention and 
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p> 
<p id="p_6">	Submitted for the kind information of the 
Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court for 
issue of appropriate order in the case."
</p>
  
<p id="p_7">	Taking note of the report, the High Court disposed of the 
Writ Petition specifically directing that the pollution norms 
and standards have to be verified periodically and if there was 
found to be any deviation,  action was to be taken. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">	In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the 
appellants submitted that in the new Master Plan 2000-2021 
the properties in question fall within Sector 10 which is 
earmarked as a residential area. Therefore, the High Court's 
judgment is not in order.
</p>
<p id="p_9">		The stand is resisted by the respondents pointing out 
that as yet the new Master Plan has not become operative and 
has not been notified and, therefore, the grievances of the 
appellants are without any basis.
</p>
<p id="p_10">	In this connection, the affidavit filed by the State of 
Punjab in compliance of this Court's order dated 7.2.2005 is 
relevant. A few paragraphs of the affidavit need to be noted.
</p>
<p id="p_11">"3. That Master Plan was prepared by this 
department which was published in the 
Punjab Govt. Gazette vide Notification 
No.8/9/84-1HGIV/1079 dated 18.1.1989 for 
public suggestions/objections. However the 
same was non-statutory.
</p>
<p id="p_12">4. That Mandi Gobindgarh, the city in 
question, does not fall under any duly notified 
Controlled Area, declared under the provisions 
of the Punjab Scheduled Roads and Controlled 
Areas (Restriction) of Un-regulated 
Development Act, 1963, now repealed. Thus 
there are no Controlled Area restrictions at 
Mandi Gobindgarh, in view of the above legal 
position.
</p>
<p id="p_13">10. That the Secretary, Housing and Urban 
Development Department of the Govt. of 
Punjab in compliance with the orders of 
Hon'ble Supreme Court has also convened a 
meeting on 31.5.2005 to discuss the issue with 
the concerned Departments viz. Department of 
Industries and Commerce, Department of 
Science and Technology and Environment, 
Punjab Pollution Control Board, Chief 
Administrator, PUDA, Department of Local 
Government, Chief Town Planner, Punjab etc. 
to take an overall view of the latest position. 
During the course of discussion, it was 
unanimously agreed upon that all the 
Departments (Punjab Pollution Control Board 
in particular) shall be more strict in initiating 
penal action against the units violating 
environmental laws, not only against those 
which are party to the present Special Leave 
Petition but against all those who are violating 
the Master Plan. This would ensure 
compliance of the orders of the Hon'ble High 
Court passed in the present case." 
</p>		

<p id="p_14">	Since the Master plan which forms the foundation of the 
appellants' challenge has not yet been notified, the effect 
thereof cannot be considered at this juncture.  When the writ 
petition was filed the old Master Plan was in force and 
continues to be in force. If, as and when there is any change 
introduced by any subsequent Master Plan, the effect thereof 
has to be considered in terms of the Notification of the said 
Master Plan. That being the position, this appeal deserves 
dismissal which we direct.  There will be no order as to costs.
