<p id="p_4">                              2.   This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner

                   challenging order dated 13.02.2009 (Annexure-5) by which the Bihar

                   State Pollution Control Board (respondent no.2) vide power conferred

                   under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">Section 31A</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution)

                   Act</a>, 1981 directed the petitioner to close his industrial/grill making

                   shop plant with immediate effect and for other ancillary reliefs.

</p><p id="p_5">                              3. Although the petitioner has an adequate remedy of

                   filing an appeal under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_3">Section 31</a> of the said Act before the appellate

                   authority constituted by the State Government where the question of

                   facts raised by the petitioner could have been considered in detail, but

                   learned counsel for the petitioner insisted that this writ petition itself
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               -2-</span>




        should be considered and decided on merits.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                   4.    Although learned counsel for the petitioner raises

        several points regarding non-consideration of the points raised in his

        show cause filed before the authority concerned, but from a bare

        perusal of the impugned order it is quite apparent that a notice was

        issued to the petitioner by the Board whereafter show cause was

        submitted by the petitioner on 07.11.2008 and the Board in its

        impugned order dated 13.02.2009 considered the same appropriately

        and only thereafter passed the impugned order.

</p><p id="p_7">                   5. It is quite apparent that the petitioner has got a shop of

        Iron Grill Work on Road No.2, Manas Marg, West Shivpuri, Patna-23

        which is a thickly populated residential locality. Furthermore, it has

        been found by the authorities that due to the operation of the aforesaid

        grill works done at the petitioner's shop, cutting of iron rods, bars,

        pipes and sheets, wielding them and making grills thereof, Ambient

        Noise Level exceeds the prescribed standards laid down for the

        residential zone. It is also found that the said shop is in utter violation

        of the provisions of the Act inflicting environmental injury to people

        of the locality under reference.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                   6. In the said circumstances, this court does not find any

        illegality in the impugned order of the Board, nor does it find any

        merit in this writ petition, which is, accordingly, dismissed.
